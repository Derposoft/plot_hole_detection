My friend disappeared and was never heard from again. by t2_h1acl9yu

When I was 11 years old (18 now) I distinctly remember having a friend who I met on the 3DS while playing Pokémon Alpha Sapphire. Her name was Autumn. She was an awesome friend, I grew up without many friends because I was always different than anyone else. She had been through the same stuff as a kid so we got along great. I remember chatting with her about video games, and we’d laugh together about silly things. Then one day she wasn’t in a good mood and I asked what was wrong. First she said she didn’t wanna talk about it. But I told her it’s okay and if she changes her mind I’m always there to listen even if she thinks I won’t like whatever it is I didn’t care I’m always there for my friends. She then began telling me reluctantly about how her mother and father were both very very strict and abusive. She expressed how scared she was of them, that the punishments she got were always so over the top and extreme even if she really didn’t do much wrong. Then she started crying and I felt so bad for her then I started crying because it broke my heart I can’t imagine how difficult that must be. She told me that she wasn’t really supposed to be talking to people online but she trusted me since I was a girl and her age. So I reassured her that I’d always be there for her, then I heard her dad come in shouting something about “who the hell are you talking to!” She starts crying and screaming and I could hear the sounds of her being either whipped with a belt or spanked, something harsh. Screams and cries cut off and the call ends. So I’m so worried for her. Back then on 3DS there weren’t really any messaging things so what I would do was put my little mii character things bio as something so a friend of mine could read it when they got back online. I wrote “autumn plz text me when you get back. I hope your okay” days pass and I hadn’t heard anything until finally when I’m playing she got back online and immediately contacted me. This time she was in a bit better mood and I asked her if she’s okay and if things were more peaceful. She said things were okay for now and that I didn’t need to worry. So we played the game as usual and laughed together, had a really nice time chatting. Then after a while she said “I have to go dinner is ready, oh and hey.. I really care about you best friend. (I hope I see you again)” I said you too! And said have a nice dinner. After hanging up though I thought about it… “I hope I see you again?” Kinda worried me but I brushed it off, so every day after that night I would get online and wait for her but she never came online. Days passed, then weeks, months, years. Not a word from her. I felt so helpless because there was no way I could get in contact we never traded phone numbers or social media, anything. Just the 3DS. I never heard from her again and I always wonder what happened to her.

Where did you go Autumn…

Update: I decided to go onto Facebook because sometimes that’s actually a really awesome way to find someone you need to find. I typed in “Autumn” then the location to Washington and started randomly clicking on different Washington cities. Then I came across something that looked promising and my eyes went wide. Her profile banner is a bunch of mew plush toys. She had brown hair and I know Autumn had brown hair.

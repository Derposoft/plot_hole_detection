I froze in place watching him adjust his charcoal tie. He stood tall wearing a suit that matched the color of his heart. Breaking the silence of my hesitation, he began, "No dispute? Wow, that is the first." "I remember selling you my soul." I finally replied. "I knew what I was getting into." "Yes! Yes!" The devil clapped his hands with a chuckle. "I have to say, I've always had my eye on you for a reason. You were different than half of the pussies that come in here crying.*'Oh Please,'* they scream. *'I didn't know!'*" I watched the devil mimic the face of a crying man before laughing hysterically. "Can we please just get on with it? Don't you drag me to hell or something?" I asked. That comment didn't sit well with the devil at all. His expression fell before spitting, "Oh, I am terribly sorry." He placed his hand over his heart. "Are you not having a *good time?* Well," He turned towards a door that appeared behind him out of thin air. The door slowly opened into nothingness. "I guess we can start having some *fun* - can't we?" I felt my body pull towards the darkness when someone yelled from out of nowhere, "Not so fast!" The devil quickly spun around rolling his eyes. "Just when you think the parents wouldn't be home to ruin a good party." "This soul is ours under contract!" A gentleman dressed in black tie came storming up next to me. He adjusted his glasses before ripping a stack of papers from his briefcase. "What is this? Is this a sick game you've developed?" I locked eyes with the devil. He didn't say anything. He stuck his tongue out toward me and the unknown gentleman. "This person signed our User Agreement which states under Article 3, section B - rerouting to Form A, document appendix C, paragraph 4, sentence 1." The gentleman smiled. The devil cringed when moving his head along the rapid shuffling of papers by the gentleman. "Did you take this from one of my templates?" he leaned in jokingly. "Sorry, How rude of me." The gentleman extended his hand. "My name is Mr. Iris. I represent Apple in their extended legal matters." "Extended is accurate." I leaned over Mr. Iris' shoulder. "I died just twenty minutes ago." "My apologies - I hope you went without pain." Mr. Iris replied. "Enough of this! His soul is mine! I do not care what appendix you wrote! He is mine!" The devil showed his teeth. His eyes lit up like the eyes of a dragon. Mr. Iris didn't even flinch. He removed his glasses and with a calm voice whispered, "I don't want to embarrass you. Apple takes the redemption of souls very seriously. This is why it's in our User Agreement. You tricked man into biting an apple once. You will not do it again." The devil's face grew a bright red similar to the glow of hot molten. "You dare contest me?!" "Do I get a say in any of this?" I raised my hand. The devil and Mr. Iris both yelled, "No!" I just stood still. It shouldn't take long for this issue to resolve itself. Mr. Iris gave the document to the devil who vanished afterwards. "If he intends to copy our methods, we alter the agreements quite frequently." Mr. Iris smiled at me. "Let's go, you, we have a long journey ahead of us." "Not so fast!" A woman's voice called. Mr. Iris and I both turned around in surprise. "I had a special contract with this one." "Oh, Siri! It doesn't matter! We work for the same company!" Mr. Iris sighed. "Can someone just point me in a direction? I feel like this has been very confusing." I grew impatient. I just wanted the transition of death to be easy. Siri extended her arm for me to lock mine with. Mr. Iris shook his head and followed us to the door. Siri was turning the door knob when all of a sudden another voice shouted, "Not so fast!" *** To read more of my stories, visit [r/13thOlympian] (https://www.reddit.com/r/13thOlympian/)

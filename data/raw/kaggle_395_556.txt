"All this walking makes me *super jazzed*, you guys. Feet don't hurt at all, no sirree." Eldrin, the youngest mage of Quelbrig Plains, slumped her shoulders and put her hands in her pockets. She lagged far behind the other three members of the squadron: Lord Eldemere, Ranmalt and Reenma. Eldemere turned to his two accomplices. "One more moment of this and my patience shall expire." Reenma sighed. "We must persist over the Western Peak, my Lord. Your patience need last only through the evening." Eldrin continued to offer commentary from behind. "I love rocks. Don't you? Never get tired of 'em. Glad we took the scenic route, Ranmalt." After five hours, the quartet reached the other side of the mountain and discovered an open stretch of snow-covered land. "I gotta take a piss," Eldrin remarked. Before she could take another step, a thunderclap erupted in the night air. "WELCOME, MAGES OF THE QUELBRIG PLAINS. I CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO EXPERIENCE ONE ANOTHER'S DEATHS." "Mmm, nice theatrics, Tralzanar," Eldrin said, slowly clapping her hands. "I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL THRILLED TO BE HERE. I KNOW I AM. DON'T GET BORED AT ALL UP HERE, NO SIRREE." Lord Eldemere gazed at his companions in shock. "My God," he cried. "There is another." Eldrin stepped forward and sat down, crossing her legs nonchalantly. "Please, put me out of my misery." The voice in the sky chuckled, causing the mountain range in the distance to quiver. "ONLY IF YOU DO FIRST." "You better show me that pretty face of yours if you're gonna kill me. We all know you hide in the clouds to shield your insecurities, pal." "WHA--I NEVER--BAH!" A peal of lightning struck a nearby tree. "I WOULDN'T HAVE TO HIDE IN THE CLOUDS IF YOU MAGES WEREN'T SUCH MEANDERING, WHINY ASS--" "Enough!" Lord Eldemere slammed his staff against the ground. "Witness the powers of fire, wind, and rain! Come, Reenma! Come, Ranmalt!" Eldrin shook her head. "Haven't seen this before." Tralzanar chuckled. "I KNOW, RIGHT? EVERY DAMN TIME SOMEONE COMES IN TO KILL ME, IT'S THE SAME GARBAGE." "Yup." Eldrin started to mimic Lord Eldemere's speech and dramatic gestures as he continued. But just as the three mages readied their staffs -- An enormous blast of light flooded the area, and Eldrin disappeared. Lord Eldemere fell to his knees. "My God! She--He--He's taken her to the Realm Beyond Realms!" Ranmalt and Reenma ran to comfort him. "It is too late. Eldrin is no more." * Eldrin came to her senses in a dark, wooded landscape bathed in purple mist. She wiped her pants and stood up. "Wow, nice digs you've got here, Tralzanar. Tasteful. Appealing." Tralzanar approached her, now in his human form and dressed in full Dark Wizard apparel. He cleared his throat, having apparently toned down the booming voice from earlier. "You're serious?" "Absolutely not. It's hideous." "Mmm. Well, I made it hideous to compensate for your presence." "Well, I made sure to look extra ugly today just for you." "Bah!" Eldrin and Thalzanar continued their battle of caustic sarcasm for the next five centuries. Even during a bout of silence, their attempts to one-up the other held firm through narrowed eyes and raised eyebrows. The Quelbrig Plains experienced 500 years of peace, all thanks to a high concentration of snark just beyond the Western Peak.

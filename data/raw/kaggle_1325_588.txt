To check out where this ridiculous adventure goes, come read it in the sub! &nbsp; Paul Greengrass cleared his throat before yelling, "Damon! We are rolling in ten!" Everyone looked around in confusion. Ben Affleck couldn't help breaking a smile while drinking from his water bottle. Paul didn't think it was as funny as Ben did. Paul stood up from his director's seat and threw his clipboard onto the floor. "My God! The amount of time I waste on this man!" he stormed out. "Damon! Damon!" Paul spat into the megaphone he stole from the woman standing outside the door. There were employees from the set standing around in a crowd. Paul's presence separated each person from the scene. Paul's eyes widened. Matt Damon, the star of his new film, was gone. Paul stood petrified while staring at a crater where Matt's trailer had been parked. Smoke slowly rolled across the debris. "What on earth happened here? Where is Damon?!" Paul started to look around at all of the employees who were also standing around in shock. "They took him!" Someone shouted from the back. Everyone took a step back when Paul fixed his eyes onto a small boy casted as an extra on set. "Who took him? What happened?" Paul lunged forward towards the boy. "They came down from the sky and they took him!" the boy pointed upward. "Are you mad?" Paul shook his head. "Which way did they drive? Tell me now!" "They were in a ship, I swear it!" the boy started to tear. "I found him!" Ben shouted from inside. Paul didn't hesitate. He didn't care about the crater of debris behind him. He ran straight through the door inside to find Matt standing next to Ben laughing. Paul's posture slumped when he saw it wasn't Matt Damon, it was Matthew Mcconaughey. "No!" Paul screamed. "Just - relax. Everything will be okay." Matthew slid next to Paul. Paul shook his head. "I don't care if that little brat is right. I don't care if it was aliens, thugs, or even the Kardashians! They are ruining the budget of this film!" "Look, we'll figure it out. Calm down. Let's go out to his trailer," Paul interrupted Mathew, "His trailer is gone! It is nothing but debris lying at the bottom of a crater!" Paul begun to sweat. He adjusted his glasses before taking a card out of his billfold. "What do you mean it's in a crater?" Matthew's smile receded. Paul ignored the question. He stared at a business card in his hands while dialing a series of tones into his cellphone. "Who are you calling?" Matthew leaned over to look at the business card. There was no name. It just read 'Team America' above a phone number for contact. Paul smiled. "I got through." Matthew pressed his cheek against Paul's to listen in on the phone call. Matthew was about to speak before Paul hushed him with his forefinger. "Whoever took Damon won't get far." Paul noticed the little boy tip toeing through the door with a gentleman who witnessed Matt's disappearance. The boy pointed towards Paul before claiming, "he's the one lookin' for em." Matthew turned his attention while still trying to listen on the line. Keanu Reeves walked in crossing his arms. "I know where they went. We are going to need a ship." *** To read more of my stories, visit [r/13thOlympian] (https://www.reddit.com/r/13thOlympian/)

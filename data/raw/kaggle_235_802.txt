&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Alright.* He scrunched his nose upward, trying to visualize the numbers. He'd forgot his small, spiral bound, red-covered notepad that all the chefs at his restaurant were issued, and he didn't feel like pulling up the calculator app, which John had dumped in some group of apps that he never used, and always took forever to locate. One of his eyelids lifted as he glanced down at his watch: he had less than thirty minutes to buy everything and make it back to the restaurant to start his mis, or else he'd be in the weeds all night. The problem was, he couldn't figure out how much produce he needed, since they were doing an event on top of normal dinner service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we have eighteen covers for the event, plus the grilled watermelon on the menu... ugh. I'm gonna need some help." John realized that the tremendous amount of fruit he was going to be carrying to his car was going to be trouble. Plus, if he was going to need two-dozen watermelons on top of the thirty-six apples he already had in his car, how would he load it all in? John thought he remembered somewhere that a guy in Japan had grown square watermelons. Those might load in easier... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey there, can I help you find anything today?" John was torn from his thoughts and whirled around to see a short, read-headed teenager with a Star Market bib on, and a nametag identifying her as "Team Member Ann." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uh... actually, yeah. I'm going to need to buy almost all of your watermelons for this event I'm doing... I uh... I'm not sure if you could help, or if maybe you could get someone else, but I need to carry twenty-four watermelons to the car." Ann scrunched up her face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well sir, I'm perfectly capable of helping you. Don't let my height fool you, I'm pretty strong! If there are twenty four watermelons, how many would we each need to carry?" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Um... well, twelve, I guess. But that seems like a lot for you. Hell, that seems like it'd be way too much for me..." John scratched his chin, still freshly shaven from earlier. He couldn't shake it, but something felt out of place. Maybe he was forgetting something? Ann interjected herself into his thoughts again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a good point! I figure we could probably each carry two at a time. If each of us can carry two, how many people would I need to get to help us carry them all in one trip?" John pushed his glasses closer to his eyes and peered a bit more closely at Ann, who's current, expectant smile revealed braces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like, twelve people. That's a fuck-ton... sorry, a ton of people. Maybe you could just... you know what? Don't worry. I got it, thanks." Something about this girl was weird. John peered around, interested if anyone else had observed this. It was at this point, that he realized that the store was empty, save for himself, and Ann. "Whoa..." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not to worry sir! I have a plan!" Ann ran off down Aisle Nine, and John exhaled a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding in. He began to walk toward the door. Fuck this, he thought. He'd just hit up the farmers market the next town over. More expensive, but... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, John!" He turned around, an icy fist wrapping around his heart. He wasn't wearing a nametag. He wasn't a Team Member. How did she know his name? More importantly, what did she have with her? She pushed a cart that resembled a typical shopping cart, but had a long board balanced across. The board was so long, that John didn't quite understand how it had fit through the aisle. Ann and the cart-that-should-not-be came to a stop in front of him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry to keep you waiting, John. So, hey, if each watermelon weighs approximately as much as three pints of milk, how many pints of milk can we stack on one side to balance out twenty-four watermelons on the other side?" She wasn't just peppy; her level of enthusiasm was bordering on manic. She reminded John briefly of the animatronic children at the Small World ride at Disney Land. Her eyes appeared to be lolling about in their sockets wildly. John took a step backward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I uh... I have to go." Ann's eyes suddenly focused on his face. He saw his terrified reflection in the huge, dilated pupils. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, John. That's a shame. Hey, if I can run approximately one point six times as fast as you, how much of a head start will you need in order to beat me to your car?" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere in the perverse back of his mind, he began to do the math. He had a problem.

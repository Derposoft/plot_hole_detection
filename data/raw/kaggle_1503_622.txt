When I opened my eyes, I'm not sure what I expected. Half of me expected for it not to work; to find myself back to where I started with the genie shaking his head or something. The other half expected to find myself in an endless void. Never born, never dead, never, well, anything. But I opened my eyes to the same boring living room and a genie in front of me. "Uh, so it didn't work?" I raised my eyebrow with a questioning look. The genie just shrugged. "Well, I just snapped my fingers, and uh, bright light, flash and all, anddddddd here we are." He summarized as he grinned widely and held up 2 fingers. "Now, wish number 2 little man." "Wait wait wait hold up!" I waved my hands in confusion as I looked up at the floating being angrily. "If it **DID** work, then why am I still here?" I circled my whole body, affirming my existence. "Well, hm, how do I say this?" The genie pondered as he floated around me thinking of a response. Crossing my arms, I grumbled and gave him a glare until he came up in front of me. "Well, you see, you're both alive **AND** dead." He said in a as-a-matter-of-fact way. "Cuz you wished you were dead." He started. "But in order to wish that, you gotta be alive!" His hand gestured everywhere as if it helped him rationalized it too. "So now you kinda exist in your own weird world where you're both alive, and well, not!" He concluded with a thumbs up. I just stood there, dumbfounded. "So what you're saying is," I tracked his explanation down as I tried to make sense of it. "I'm in my own world cuz I'm like, in 2 states in 1?" I ended in questioning tone. "Yes! Sure!" The genie gave me a half-convincing grin as he flew around excitedly. "Whatever helps you make sense of this!" Confused still, I walked around the house to see if interactions can yield some answers. But it seemed to only get more confusing. When I try to touch something, I will either successfully touch it or have my hand go through it. Trying to talk with my sister felt like a broken telephone game, as sometimes she'd either not hear me at all or perfectly respond as if I was there. Confused, I looked up to the genie. "So now I'm in my own fucked up little world." I surmised as I threw my hands up in defeat; my right left sunk to the floor while my left felt the hardwood bottom. "Now I get to be oh so alone." I pouted as I crossed my arms. "Well, it ain't so bad." The genie tried to comfort me as he pointed to an approaching figure. "You got some company still." "Meow." Looking to my left, I saw a small ragdoll cat approach towards my direction; it seemed to waver in and out of existence too. When it saw me, the cat quickly let out a yelp and ran towards my direction. To my surprise, the cat started rubbing its head on my leg, purring contentedly. "Wha---" "Looks like we found Schrodinger's cat!" The genie said victoriously as he swooped up and down in celebration. "Told you you weren't alone!" "Yeah, guess so." I said with a sort of sad tone as I picked up the cat. It let out a small mew as it continued to rub its head on my hand. Suddenly, the foreboding bleakness seemed to wash away as I felt myself smile looking at the cat. It purred back in response. "Guess we got some company after all." **Read more at** [**SH**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shiruet/)

"Alright men!" Sarge shouted, rotating around. "We've been abandoned by our maker in these Godforsaken wilds. All we know for certain is that we're not going back home." "But we're in the Great Dunes, nothing lives here," Private Bob responded. "Look to the skies," Sarge responded, angling himself to point to the sky. Ravenous fiends, winged beasts from beyond our world began circling above us. One swooped down and pecked at Private Tom; it would have dragged him away were it not for its gag reflex, forcing him to fall back to the Earth. "TOM!" Private James shouted, struggling to make an effort to catch him; however, the sands trapped his small, green feet, and he couldn't seem to move through the shifting sands. "It's alright!" Tom shouted. "I'm still alive! The fall wasn't too-" Another winged fiend swooped down and carried him away. "Damnit! Find cover!" Sarge commanded, hitting the ground and starting to dig a trench. "What *are* these beasts?!" "They call them... pigeons. Relentless, dirty, and evil. They will stop at nothing until they have devoured us all." No more than three minutes later, we had all made a small digout, and had crawled inside. "It's getting dark," James spoke meekly, cowering deeper. "All manners of monsters crawl out from hell at night," Sarge responded, lighting his bright green cigarette. "Worms, beetles, ants... I shouldn't frighten you. We can make it through this." As if on cue, the sands behind them began to shift. A pair of mandibles peeked through. "ANT!" Bob screamed, running away. Sarge walked up and kicked it in the head, prompting it to scurry away. "Get a hold of yourself, damnit!" Sarge shouted, slapping Bob across the face. "It's only one ant! They're only dangerous in..." He trailed off as he heard a massive rumbling. First, a pair of mandibles protruded. Then two. Then four, eight, a hundred: the horde was innumerable. "There's only a thousand of them! Each soldier, get fifty, and we should be fine!" He kicked a couple of ants, sending them running, before a third grabbed a hold of him and began chewing through his foot. "Hold fast! Don't-AHH!" Four more ants seized him and he fell. "Sarge!" Bob cried out, himself falling under a group of ants. James ran away, leaving the rest of his squadron to die; he wasn't going to risk himself for their sake. Every man for himself, as he had once heard. ~~---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~ The next morning, James peeked out from his cover. There was naught but green scraps where his comrades used to be. He began to weep. A massive rumbling sounded from behind; he turned to see that the maker had returned. "WHY! WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN US!" James shouted; the maker didn't respond. "Huh, I thought I left them right here," the maker muttered, ignoring James' wriggling, digging through the sand and dirt. "There you are!" He retrieved the army men from beneath the sand. "Aww, they're a little chewed up!" he lamented, brushing them clean. He took them and James in his arms, and walked back to his eternal abode. "Sarge!" James shouted, once they were safe. "Bob, Billy, are you alright?" "We'll live. Shame you ditched us, we almost got all of them!" Sarge responded, laughing. "It's a miracle! The maker truly can do anything, even bring back the dead!" "Praise be upon him," Sarge spoke, looking up to the bright light. "Praise be upon him," everyone responded in unison.

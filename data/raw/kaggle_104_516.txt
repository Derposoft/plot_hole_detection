"I woke up this morning and like Magic the squeaky stair no longer squeaked and the floorboard that always tripped me up was as even as all the rest, I'm telling you he visited me last night!" One man said to another as they stood outside the local pub, cigarettes in hand as they talked. "Bill you're fucking nuts is what you are," the shorter of the two replied, "It was probably you in a drunken stupor last night, you do some weird shit when you're drunk," he waved his hand holding the cigarette dismissively, ash raining down like a small snow storm in its wake. "I'm telling ya Jimmy it was them fairies everyone's talking about," Bill replied insistently, tugging at his beard before lifting his cigarette to his lips and sucking deeply the toxic fumes into his lungs, the smoke puffed out of him on a wheeze. Jimmy just shook his head as if he thought Bill daft, which he probably did. Over the next few days more and more people started talking about the strange things happening in the middle of the night, creaky, broken and warped steps and porches magically fixed, leaky pipes mended, garage door openers which hadn't worked in months suddenly working again. In one memorable morning Juliane at number six woke up to find her half renovated kitchen completely finished. The small town of Ballybrook was convinced they'd been blessed with a flock of handyman fairies. The fact that a watch here and there or some jewellery went missing at the same time, well it wasn't really worth mentioning. Things went missing all the time and besides the miraculous fixings happening all over town were much more interesting to talk about. "Mama said it was da toof fairy," Lily Small a little girl of four with a couple missing teeth was heard telling everyone that would listen while out and about with her nan. "I heard Geoffrey said they painted his fence and weeded his garden," Paul said one evening at poker night, "But I'm pretty sure it was just his son, you know Geoff, he'd forget his own head if it weren't screwed on," the others around the table mumbled and nodded in agreement, that sure sounded like Geoff. The instances kept happening for weeks, then months then finally exactly a year to the date of the first reported fixing, they stopped. That day the whole town seemed to fall into hushed whispering darting furtive glances every which way as if waiting for something terrible to happen. So preoccupied with this impending sense of doom that not a single person noticed young Susie Jenkins leave town in her brand new Ferrari which everyone knew she couldn't afford, ready to hit the next town, and the next, and the next. She smiled brightly as she left the small town behind, wind whipping her hair around, who said you couldn't be good while also being bad? ____________________________________________________ That was fun, I haven't written in months so thanks for the inspiring prompt to get me going again!

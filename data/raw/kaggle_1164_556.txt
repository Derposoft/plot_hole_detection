Super Guy and Villain Man once again find themselves locked in an epic battle in the city in which they reside. After a long chase, the two adversaries wind up in alleyway. Villain Man is cornered with two buildings on his side and a brick wall behind him. **BANG BANG BANG** Villain Man lets loose with his hand cannon. Super Guy maneuvers left and right, dodging the bullets with ease. "Hahaha!" shouts Super Guy, "try harder!" "Son of a bitch!" yells Villain Man, frustrated. He tries to run past Super Guy, but to no avail. Super Guy blasts Villain Man with a right hook, sending him 20 feet back in to the the brick wall. Villain Man falls limp, lying motionless on the ground. Super Guy approaches Villain Man slowly. "I've been toying with you for years now" laughs Super Guy, "catching you, letting you go, then catching you again. All so this city can call me their hero and savior. But now, you've disrespected my mother. Prepare for your end." Villain Man, playing possum, senses Super Guy just feet from where he is laying. He picks up his head and pulls out his gun, aiming it straight at Super Guy's head. **BANG** The bullet deflects off of Super Guy's skull. **BANG BANG BANG** Three more bullets ricochet left and right without even scratching the hero. "Ha! Good trick! I can't believe this is the first time you've landed a bullet!" *click* Villain Man pulls the trigger once more out of desperation. He's run out of bullets. "No!" shouts Villain Man as Super Guy laughs. With no other options, Villain Man hurls his gun at Super Guy. *-----------* Time seems to freeze for Super Guy as he sees the gun approaching. *How could I be so foolish?* he thinks to himself, *my only weakness.* The gun continues its approach. Super Guy tries to move but he is frozen, helpless. *Did I push Villain Man too far? He hasn't done anything evil per se. I framed him for all of those crimes he's accused of.* Super Guy tries his laser beam eyes. Nothing. The gun starts to close in. *All I wanted was to be loved by this city! But it was too peaceful! No one needed a super hero. So what choice did I have but to create a villain? Someone who gives me a reason to live. And a way to make a living, of course. The local news stations love the footage.* He glances at the video camera mounted on his chest. He looks back up, the gun is mere inches from his face. *This is so embarrassing. I just hope I'm still respected after all of this. I hope to always be known as Super Guy, brave hero, and better friend!* The gun connects. Super Guy lets out a scream as he feels his body start to decompose. With a mighty *poof* his body turns to dust and falls to the floor. *----------* Villain Man stands up in the alleyway, shocked and alone. He takes a few steps toward the pile of dust in front of him. "What the hell?" Edit: As much as I enjoyed the explanation made by u/re5etx , I fixed the spelling of Villain. Turns out autocorrect doesn't work for capitalized words. But I'm glad you all enjoyed it!

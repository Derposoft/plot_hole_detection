The soldiers anxiously gripped their guns, awaiting their doom. The entire world had been conquered with no resistance whatsoever, and they knew they stood no chance. Still, it was better to die fighting for freedom than to lay down and accept their fate. And yet, as the days went by, no invasion came. At first they considered it some kind of tactic - to mentally ruin them before conquering the country - but it made little sense. The aliens had technology that far surpassed that of their own, so what was the use in delaying their arrival? ******** "Damn it man, give me a map!" the general shouted, letting frustration get the better of him. It had already been almost a week. A private hurried over with a map, and the general grabbed it. "See, look here - they've conquered every goddamn country," he said, pointing rapidly at each continent, "and yet, they haven't even- *oh for fucks sake!*" The general was pointing at where New Zealand *should* have been, but it was open sea. Everyone in the room sighed. "Can you get me another map, private? One that doesn't fucking leave out our country entirely?" The private nodded, and turned to leave. Then he stopped. "Sir... do you think that could be it?" Everyone in the room turned towards the private. "What do you mean?" the general asked, his patience wearing thin. "Maybe the reason they haven't invaded is because we're not on any maps, sir? Maybe they just don't know we exist?" The room fell silent. The general considered it for a long while, slowly putting the map down and surveying it. Then he burst out laughing. It took him ages to stop, and he wiped away his tears when he eventually did. "God damn it, man, I think you might be right. I think you might just be right." He looked at the assembled military, regaining his composure. "So let's assume that's the case, since we don't have any better ideas. We've been given a massive opportunity here. We've got time. We can plan. The few weaknesses the aliens have can be exploited, and with a little luck, we can take back our planet from the alien scum. It's the best shot we've got." A major shook his head. "But how, general? America, Russia, China - hell, even North Korea - none of them stood a chance." "That's because none of them *had a chance*, major. EMP waves took down their defences before the aliens even arrived, a simultaneous attack that sent all electronics down. No one had any warning, any time. But now we've got all the time in the world." Everyone in the room felt a glimmer of hope, for the first time since the aliens arrived on earth. "So what do we do now, sir?" the major asked. "How do we defeat them?" The general smiled, lighting up a cigar. "We swing away, major. *We swing the fuck away*." ***** If you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/) I'll try add new (and old) stories every day <3

I opened the fridge door for some water. God, I was thirsty. Why do I always forget to carry water with me when I come back home from work? I gulped down half a bottle of water and closed the fridge. As I walked towards my room, I felt a sharp tug and my stomach felt weird. It was as though I was on a roller coaster. I closed my eyes to collect myself. It must be the dehydration, I thought. I was sweating. I opened my eyes only to find that I was no longer at home. The ambient lights around me were red, orange and shades of yellow. I could smell a rusty odor. Arcane symbols, bones and blood were around me. "Holy Fuck." I exclaimed. "You're not supposed to use that word." A small being mumbled. He looked humanoid but it was clear that he wasn't an earthly being. "You mean the F-word?" I frowned. Great. I just cussed in front of a child. I tried to walk towards him but for some reason I was wasn't able to move out of the symbols that was drawn below me, on the ground. "Um, no. The H-word. It's bad. My parents would beat the crap out of me if they heard me use that." He shuddered. I wonder if he actually got beaten up by them. I also noticed that he had a tail with a sharp pointy end. "Hasn't anyone told you that it's rude to stare at someone's tail?" He frowned. "Oh. Sorry. No one has tails on earth. Wait. Where am I?" I looked around to find a clue about my whereabouts. "You're in Hell." "HELL!?" "Great." The child groaned. "I summoned a broken one. Yes, hell. Underworld. Yada yada yada " "Wait. Am I dead? Why am I in hell?" I began to panic. Why am I in hell? Was it because I refused to share my Pizza with Karen? "You're not dead. I summoned you." He pointed to the symbols beneath my feet. "I didn't think it would work. But it did." He held a book with leather bindings. "Summoned me? How? Can demons summon humans?" This is ridiculous. I pinched myself to check if I was dreaming. "I don't know." The kid shrugged. "It was supposed to be a myth. I found a book in the library and tried to summon one. Listen, can you help me?" "Help you? How? I am just a human. You have magic. Dark magic." "Well.... My school has a few subjects that help us hide among humans without drawing attention to ourselves." He looked at the ground, embarrassed. "I needed help with a homework. Can you help me? " "Jesus Christ--" I exclaiming. "That name is prohibited!!" The child's eyes went wide. "Fine." I huffed. "What is it? If it's math, kid, you're out of luck because I can't do math to save my own life." "Wow. Math is easy. You must be really dumb then." He snickered. "No. I needed help with this." He handed me the book he was holding. I opened the book. "Memes". I smirked at the kid. My time to shine was here. "Kid, you better bring your pen, paper and be prepared to have your wig snatched because this is going to be one hell of a lesson."

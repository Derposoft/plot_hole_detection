"It's raw!" Gordon says and smashes the burger. "It's fucking raw! You can't serve a raw patty to your customers!" Plankton frowns. "But---" "And I don't care about your excuses! Just look at the Krusty Krab across the street! How can they make a bloody good burger?!" "Aghh..." Plankton spreads his arms. "Krabby Patty secret form---" "You fucking muppet! Say it again! I dare you, just mention it again and I'm out of here!" "He keeps it in a bottle." "Oh, fuck off! ~~There is no secret formula!~~ The fact is that you don't care and you don't have a fucking clue! That's why you are so bad! You are serving your customers raaaaaaaw meat!" "We are under water!" Plankton yells "Fuck off, I'm shutting this down." And then, for some reason everything turns to black, dramatic drums sound and shortly after we're back in the kitchen, with Plankton and Gordon standing in an air bubble with a lit grill and a table with many cups, bowls and various ingredients. You know, kinda like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM_KMYulI_s&t=135s) but with plankton and underwater. Gordon is calm and so is the Plankton. ***Drum***Drum***Drum*** "Plankton, I'm going to show you how to make the most amazing burger." Plankton nods. He points to a bowl with meat in front of him. "The secret of burger is in the blend - the most amazing chuck, ground beef and brisket. Are you with me?" Plankton nods. "First, you will form six round patties with your hands, yeah. Grab the meat, squeeze it, tap it from both sides until it's 2 inches thick and then shape it into a perfect round burger patty shape." Plankton nods, gives him a thumbs up with his tiny stick-like hands, and starts making the patties. "Oh, for fuck sake, Plankton! Use all your fingers! Use the thumbs, you fuckface! Press, then shape. Press and shape! With all your fingers! Why are you so slow? All your-- Oh, for fuck sake, how many fingers do you have?" ***Drum***Drum***Drum*** cut scene *** It's tomorrow. "Good." Gordon, who is calm again, says to Plankton. "Now that you've made patties and let them sit in the fridge overnight so they are nice and firm, it's time to season them. " He takes a pepper shaker. "Salt, pepper on one side. Flip. Salt, pepper again. A little touch of grapeseed oil on the burger. Be sure that you season it well. Sides too. Roll it to season sides. Do it well because you can't season it later. Now, turn the grill on. We have it on already. Get it piping hot so they don't fall apart." He takes a breath. "This is my favorite burger recipe. The best burger in my restaurants. I serve it in hotel in Vegas. After you season it, let it stay on the tray, for a minute. Let it rest. It needs to rest to soak up the seasoning flavors, yeah?" Plankton scratches his head. "Good. Grill." He opens the grill he started before the drums and the cut scene. "Piping hot. Now, put the burger on the grill, make sure it sizzles. If it doesn't, it's not hot enough. Okay?" Plankton frowns. "Why are you looking at me like that? It's your turn to do this. What are you waiting for, an invitation? Do it. Muppet" Plankton looks at Gordon then at burger which is larger and heavier than him and then at the grill which is too big for Plankton to use. "Oh, c'mon..." Gordon flaps his arms in disbelief. ***Drum***Drum***Drum*** cut scene again*** Gordon is calm again. There is a stool next to the grill and Plankton is standing on it. Plankton is holding grill tongs. Patties are on the grill, sizzling. Gordon turns. "Good. Now we cook them. Don't move the patties on the grill, they'll break. That's the secret of making a good burger, you don't move it. Last step --- lid down." He closes the lid. Gordon turns to face the Plankton. "Now, the bun--- Whe--? Where is he? Where did he go?" Gordon turns. "Where did Plankton go?" "Give me the secret formula!" Plankton's voice says, coming from the outside. "What the--" Gordon says. "Is he outside? He left! I don't believe this." Gordon leaves the restaurant and crosses the street. There, in front of the Krusty Krab is Plankton, and he is holding a megaphone. "Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab!" "Plankton! What the fuck are you doing!?!" screams Gordon. Plankton lowers the megaphone and turns to Gordon. "This is not working, Gordon. Your burger, it's too complicated. Stealing the Krabby Patty secret formula from there"--- he points at the Krusty Krab --- "is much easier." He lifts the megaphone and turns back to faces the restaurant "Give me the Krabby Patty secret formula or I'll destroy you!" Gordon spread his hands and turns to metaphorical camera which may or may not exist in this story. "Fuck this! I'm done! He can take his restaurant and stick it in his"--- he takes off the apron ---"I'm done." ***Drum***Drum***Drum*** ***screen turns to black*** &#x200B; &#x200B; *WN:* *This was a fun challenge to to write b/c I needed to google Plankton. Hopefully, I didn't get him very wrong. If I did.. oh, well. Sorry.* &#x200B; /r/ZwhoWrites

It always ended up in someone getting impaled on ice or something, broken skulls and rib cages from those with super strength, 3rd degree burns from the victims of nicer crooks who could control fire...the full charcoal treatment for those that weren't so nice. Yeah, a person could find any number of gruesome ways to kill someone if they had powers. But when that one guy started killing. It was the worst I'd ever seen. The precinct had been getting reports lately of huge numbers of whiplash patients at hospitals around the city. They were all interviewed and their statements were all the same. A tap on the shoulder and their neck snapped that way so fast it pulled something and they had to go to the hospital. "The Tapper", as the force started calling him, had been reported to hang around the subway and Times Square at its busiest. Eye witnesses said that he didn't look like anything. Just a guy in a grey hoodie and shades. Nothing like the flashy bastards flying around. The problem with that was that we couldn't just issue a public statement asking people to stop wearing hoodies because he would just change his clothes and keep going. It was decided that, with murders going on, and stores being robbed at gunpoint, a guy making people uncomfortable for a few weeks wasn't as important. The chief issued an official statement telling the security companies on and around the subway to put more eyes down there and report anything suspicious. The victims were pissed. They wanted justice. They claimed it was a form of assault. Sure, it could be considered that, but with a guy shot dead on 7th and Grove, we had more important matters. That was, until the latest case. I arrived on the scene to a couple of officers with their heads in their hands, mumbling. Another one was standing in the gutter retching his lunch up. I mentally ran through all the training images they made us look at for my job. All the disgusting things that humanity is capable of. I walked up to the ranking officer and asked "What have we got, Davids? Another victim of the Peeler?" I mentioned the name of a normie criminal who had taken to flaying his victims hands and feet. "No, Roger...no. Eye witnesses are claiming it was the Tapper." "What? Someone's neck finally broke?" "I wish, man. Look, I know you're the photographer, but you don't have to look at this. If you want, I can take your camera and do it for you." "Heh, Davids, you know me. I'm sure I've seen worse things on r/fiftyfifty," I laughed at the notion as I stepped into the lights illuminating the crime scene. "Oh fuck..." I stopped dead as I saw the body. What I thought would just be a broken neck was far, far worse. "Yeah. Witnesses say he touched both this poor bastards shoulders, and that happened. They say his screams were worse than the last attack by the Scaremonger." Lying there in a giant pool of his own blood was a man of about 35-40. His body seemed fine, if dead and limp. His head, though. His face had torn in a jagged line, right down the middle. Nose, tongue, skull, everything. Like a hot dog bun, from the front, all the way to the back. Ragged bits of flesh, bone, and brain were hanging from either side, and the man's eyes are locked in a look of absolute horror. "Davids...I think it's time the Tapper was bumped up the wanted list..." I managed to stammer out before I opened the paper bag and plunged my face in it. --- More on r/SamsStoriesSub

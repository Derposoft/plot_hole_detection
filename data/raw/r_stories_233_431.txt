Doctor Has a Problem During Surgery by t2_4larhi7g

This story was told to me by a nurse a few days ago while I was in hospital after surgery and I thought that Reddit is the best place to tell it. Enjoy!

The story starts like any normal day for Doctor Nick, a surgeon at the local hospital. His last surgery of that day was a middle aged woman getting abdominal surgery. Doctor Nick has been a surgeon for well over 30 years, so needless to say, he's got this.

The surgery begins, and all was going well. Until midway through the surgery, when Doctor Nick founds a problem. His 30 years of surgery did not prepare him for what was about to happen, and as his life flashed before him, he knew he needed help.

**NURSE 1**: *(seeing the panic on Doctor Nick's face. but not knowing what was wrong)* "Doctor, is everything ok?"

Doctor Nick looked down to his patient, knowing in that moment that her life was in his hands. He couldn't stop, but he knew he needed help.

**DOCTOR NICK**: *(looking up to Nurse 1)* "There seems to be a problem."

**NURSE 1**: "What's wrong? What do you need?"

Doctor Nick looked to his patient and then to the nurses, contemplating the last 30 years. This had never happened to him before, and without help, he didn't know what could be done.

**DOCTOR NICK**: "Nurse 2, I need your assistance."

**NURSE 2**: "Yes, doctor. What is it?"

**DOCTOR NICK**: "I need you to come behind me."

*Nurse 2, still not knowing what the problem was, came to Doctor Nick's aid.*

"What is it doctor?"

**DOCTOR NICK**: *(with dread, embarrassment and panic in hos voice)* "Nurse 2, my pants are falling down."

Doctor Nick, with his small stature and lack of hips, could feel his hospital scrubs sliding down his waist during the procedure. His hands were tied in the abdomen of the woman in front of him, and he knew that he needed assistance in order to continue.

Nurse 2 came from behind Doctor Nick, grasped his pant scrub straps and pulled them back up, tying them back in place.

* *I hope this story was entertaining for you to read. The story was simple but funny, so I thought I'd put a comical spin on it. Incase you're wondering, I had a hysterotomy (something I wanted) and I'm doing well after my surgery. Writing is like therapy for me, so expect to read more stories about my time in hospital (a Karen in my ward that I'm sure you'll find entertaining).*

Thanks for reading.

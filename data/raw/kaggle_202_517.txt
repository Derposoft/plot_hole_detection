Brian's father, who also happened to be the king, had arranged the whole thing with the invading savages. The Swedish Vikings had plagued the land for decades, and this was the deal that would end the raids - the marriage between the crown prince and the Viking chieftain's daughter. "Hey, are you quite all right?" Brian said and looked over at his bride. "I promise I won't touch you if you don't want me to." Frida pulled at her dress. "[Jag forstar inte ett ord av vad du sager, men jag ser fram emot att komma ur denna klanning.](/s "I don't get a word you're saying, but I'm looking forward to getting out of this dress.") " "I'm not very fond of this arrangement either," Brian said. "[Hur langt ar det kvar till slottet?](/s "How far is it to the castle?")" Frida said and ripped the sleeve off her dress. "[Ar du bra i sacken?](/s "Are you good in the sack?")" "I'm sorry you had to wear that. I'm sure the dresses you have back home are much more comfortable." "[Snackar alla engelsman sa har mycket?](/s "Does every englishman talk this much?")" Frida said with a scowl. "[Ta mig pa golvet bara.](/s "Just take me on the floor already.")" "I get that you're upset - I am too. But let's make the best of the situation, okay?" "[Herregud, detta endlosa babbel,](/s "Oh my god, this endless chatter,")" Frida said and rolled her eyes. "[Det ar som att man hamnat i Norge.](/s "It's like I've ended up in Norway.")" Finally, the carriage arrived at the castle. The spires of gray rock almost pierced the clouds. Brian helped Frida down and then showed her into his chambers. She sat down on the royal bed, still fidgeting with the dress. "I get it if you don't want to consummate the marriage." Brian gently put his hand on her shoulder. "It's okay. I'll even sleep on the couch; do you want me to sleep on the couch?" "[Antligen ror du mig; det tog sin lilla tid,](/s "Finally you're touching me; that took some time,")" she said and nodded vigorously. "[Borjade tro att du var bog.](/s "Was starting to think you were gay.")" "Okay, then," Brian said and walked over to couch. "[Kom igen da!](/s "Come on, then!")" Frida said, and pulled her dress down. "Oh, I'm so sorry," Brian said and covered his eyes. "I'll give you some privacy. I'll be in the next room if you need me." He had been the perfect gentleman given the situation, and perhaps after enough time Frida would come to like him. She was a very pretty young woman, and any man would be proud to call her his wife. He sighed and left the room. "[Men for i helvete!](/s "What the hell!")" Frida said, and sighed. **** [r/Lilwa_Dexel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lilwa_Dexel/comments/5foev0/welcome/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6dt0fl/wp_write_a_story_in_two_or_more_languages_it/di58qzt/)

"It has no weaknesses. Glammorang has laid waste to this land for months and still we have made no headway on ridding ourselves of this menace." Councilor Verath's tones echoed throughout the Hearing Chamber, rising above the layers of whispers and mumbles between the various lords, ladies and other dignitaries assembled to discuss the matter. "The Dragon Hunters lay in shambles, their finery a poor substitute for the sort of military might needed to address this situation." Lord Bammoth stomped to his feet, his face red and veins pulsing in his throat, "You overstep yourself Councilor Verath," he spit the last two words, making it clear what the noble thought of the people's appointee. "We have safeguarded these lands for decades with nary a disturbance." Lady Blorrin giggles, "That's because you haven't had to actually fight anyone Navin." Lord Bammoth attempted a stuttered response before sinking back into his chair with a grumble, "Now, Council Verath, we are all quite aware of the state of affairs, restating them moves us no closer to a solution. What do you propose we do?" Councilor Verath shifted his weight, suddenly uncomfortable. After collecting his thoughts, he spoke again, "We are simply not equipped to fight a Red. Perhaps not a dragon of any stripe, but certainly not a red. Our weapons do not pierce it's hide, our magic is absorbed by it, our walls are not thick enough to resist it. We must come at this problem sideways. Head on will not work." Lady Blorrin rolled her eyes and made a circling motion with her finger, instructing him to get to the point. Verath nodded and then charged onward, "I believe we must gain leverage over the beast somehow. We must convince it that it has something it desires and use that to negotiate." Lord Bammoth released a great guffaw, "Negotiate? With a dragon?" Verath shifted his eyes to Gavin, "Indeed. Dragons are quite intelligent, which is more than can be said for some of the folks on our side," he let a pause draw out, making it very clear who he thought that sentiment applied to. "If we can create a dynamic where we acquire such leverage, perhaps we can compel it to leave these lands." "So, Councilor, what do we have that the dragon might desire that it cannot simply take?" Lady Blorrin asked. "When Glammorang first appeared, we set the scholars to the task of gathering information about the dragon. We have discovered a number of things. One, Glammorang is not an it, it is a she. Two, her spawn has been hunted to extinction and she has grown too old to find a new mate," Councilor Verath said. "And how do we take advantage of this situation?" Lady Blorrin asked. "We believe we already have," he coughed into his hand and then continued, "we introduced a new element into the equation two weeks past. We believe it has had the intended effect." "Well don't leave us on tenterhooks you damnable man, out with it!" Bammoth roared from the sidelines, his patience sorely tested. Lady Blorrin simply stared at Verath, an expectant look on her face. "Yes, well, um...we released a duckling into her lair." "A duckling." Lady Blorrin said, her eyebrow arched. "Yes. We thought that the dragon might grow attached to it, start to see it as her own." Councilor Verath looked increasingly uncomfortable now. "And has she?" Blorrin asked. "She has." "And?" Blorrin pushed, finding the exercise of drawing questions out of the man increasingly annoying. "Well, we are having some issues recovering the duckling. She has taken to guarding it rather fiercely." Verath pulled a handkerchief out of the folds of his robe and mopped his brow, "And our attempts at recapturing the duckling has caused Glammorang to become much more fiercely territorial." "What has she done?" Lord Bammoth asked. "She has taken to scouring the countryside of all living things that may prove to be a threat to the duckling." Lord Bammoth spluttered, "What?" "Yes, umm...instead of opportunistic attacks for resources, she is simply slaughtering everything within a certain radius of her lair, progressively expanding outward." Lord Bammoth blinked, "My lordhold is only handful of miles from her last reported lair." "Ahhh, that is true. An unfortunate quirk of fate. There is also some reason to believe she might associate your castle with the duckling hunters." "And why would she do that?" Bammoth asked. "Because the last group of hunters set forth from Castle Bammoth," Councilor Verath replied, exercising a great effort to look everywhere in the room but Lord Bammoth. "What are you saying, that my castle will be under siege?" "No, I'm say--" "Well that's a relief," Lord Bammoth cut in. "Ahem, well, this is awkward," Councilor Verath replied, trying to continue his thought, "I'm saying that Castle Bammoth is no more, Glammorang exacted her revenge on it two nights past. I assumed your raven would reach you before mine did." "WELL THAT'LL BE PRETTY DAMN DIFFICULT IF ALL OF MY RAVENS HAVE BEEN FRIED TO A CINDER," Bammoth cried out. Lady Blorrin released an exquisitely poorly timed giggle. "I suppose that's so..." Councilor Verath replied. "So, all of my lands, destroyed? That's what you're saying?" Bammoth continued, his face splotched with rage. "Yes." "Over a duckling?" "Yes." Lord Bammoth fell back into his chair in a stupor. Councilor Verath, seeing the room slip away hastened onward, "But do not worry, we consider this plan a success," Bammoth began to sob in the background, "it was simply our execution of the plan that fell through. We believe if we introduce a second duckling into the situation--" "--No! No more ducklings!" Lady Blorrin cut in. "Yes, perhaps that is best. We have a fallback plan with an adolescent aardvark..." **Platypus out.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

"The Nightmare Zone" --- --- I'm fine. I promise, I'm fine. Let's get back to the story now. Where were we? Alice had just found herself in the Nightmare Zone. It's pitch black in there. She can't see anything, right? Yeah, I think that's where I left off. Right, so Alice. She lights her torch, and instantly, there are thousands of spiders. I'm sorry, excuse me? Spiders? Oh. Says here they are "harmless spiders." Sorry, I missed that word. Thousands of *harmless spiders*. Alice is surrounded by them. The story continues. Wait. That can't be right. Excuse me? She lays down in the bed of spiders, and lets them crawl on her skin, and... no. Lick her wounds? Harmless spiders. Not spiders with tongues. Who wrote this? This is *not* okay. > The man, thoroughly filled with anxiety, stood up from his lonely chair in the middle of a sun-filled empty room. No audience for this reading, it seems. Still, he persisted, for the practice. Let me calm myself. I need to tell the story. I can't keep interrupting it. So, the spider tongues. They- > The man literally paused for an anxious internal scream, and sat back down in his chair to focus. They- > He let out a deep breath, trying to calm himself. The spiders. They licked her wounds, and helped her stand. They helped the wounded, weak Alice stand. "Thank you," Alice said to them. "It's no problem...," the spiders collectively skittered and shrieked. She gave the queen spider, the biggest of them all, a kiss on her drippy mandibles. The two shared a hug. Some of the spider-kids joined in. > The man, at this point, had terror tears running down his face. But still, he persisted. Alice. So, she says... says it right here. Word for word: "I kind of liked that." I'm *sorry.* I can't. I can't read this. I thought- I thought I could. I thought I could do it. Handle *really* reading a story without becoming emotionally affected by it. I can't. I just can't. > The man threw the book down, done. He stood up, and walked to look out the window. Below him, a busy city. It's alright. I just need to calm down. Deep breaths. > He closed his eyes, and took deep breaths. He focused on the feeling of sun on his face, on the sound of the city. He focused on the smell of construction, on the empty room, and on how well his life has been. He opened his eyes to a pitch darkness. Thousands of totally harmless spiders skittered about him, plus their queen. *No.* No, it's not real. It's not *real.* > On set the panic tremors and tears I'd rather die. I'd rather die. No, no help me please. Somebody! Oh my god, the spiders, they're on my skin. They're on my skin. No! Their tongues, their tongues oh my god their tongues. My *ears.* > The man started to scream. "What's the matter?," the queen said. "Alice just left us. She was quite nice. But you..." You're not real! You're not real! > Still, the man screamed. He clawed at his skin in an effort to break the thousands of tiny tongues which licked at him. "Oh, we're very real. Have you never read The Nightmare Zone?" The queen said. "You must have, else you wouldn't be here." > The man... Then, the man, he... --- Fin: ---- > A horror story told by a narrator who is easily spooked.

Any and all constructive criticism is appreciated! I will likely be toying with this to make it better for a little bit, but it's very late here. I think I got my idea across well enough :-) My first thought is that it's too fast. This story could do well to expand a little. My next thought is that, if a reader had never read the prompt, they wouldn't really understand what's going on. --- [self-promo (already clicky, do not click)](https://pastebin.com/sN2Svgf8)

"*Bang, bang*, **bang**!" shouted the old man in torn, mismatched clothing. His index fingers were pressed together and pointing at my purse. Then, he cupped his hands over his mouth and made a hideous guttural sound, followed by a few deep breaths. Bad ventriloquism. "There you go madam," he said gruffly. "You're safe now." In the darkness of the alley, the silhouette of his hands had looked a little like a gun, and I'd reluctantly acquiesced to the mugging by throwing my purse on the ground. Only now, with my eyes adjusted to the dark, I realised I'd been mistaken. There had been no mugging - just a scrawny old man with a screw or two lose, thinking he was doing some good. "Uh... thanks," I stuttered, walking over to my purse. "Maybe I can get you a coffee or something, to repay you for your kindness." "I'm just doing my duty as a citizen of the Orion alliance. No reward is necessary." I saw his tongue dart out and wet his cracked lips. "Although, a thank you pastry wouldn't be, erm, *unacceptable*." "Oh. Okay, well, there's a bakery around the corner," I replied, picking up my purse. "I'm Elizabeth. What's your name?" He paused for a moment as he thought. "Derek," he said, finally. The street was dark and quiet, hushed by the Sunday night blues. Boris' Bakery however, was as open as always. I pushed the door and held it open for my new friend to enter through. There was no one behind the counter, but the sweet scent of freshly baked bread came drifting out from the back. There wasn't much choice available at this hour, but Derek was already pawing at the glass counter, salivating at the sight of half stale Danish pastries. "Have anything you want. Hell, have a few things. I owe you big time," I said, smiling politely. Poor guy needed a good meal. I hadn't really noticed his smell before, but now we were in an enclosed space, Derek's strange odour was becoming prominent. But it wasn't the smell of body odour or urine. It was something else. Something I recognised but couldn't put my finger on. Maybe a little sulphurous. I opened my handbag and looked in my purse, wanting to make sure I had enough money to pay for the feast I felt certain Derek would be ordering. There was a hole in my purse! - about an inch and a half in diameter. Most of my coins had already escaped through it, but some were still trickling out into my handbag like a nickel waterfall. But more worrying than that, was the black substance coalescing around the hole, bubbling and stretching, as if trying to heal over a wound. "*Don't trust him,*" came the gurgled whisper from my purse. "What the-" Derek turned. "Ey?" "Oh, erm, nothing. I was just checking my phone. Ex says he wants to meet up. It was a bit of a surprise." "Ah, probably just a booty call," said Derek, as he went back to the counter, peering down through the glass and licking his lips. "That's probably it," I murmured in agreement, gazing back down into my handbag. "Run," my purse pleaded. I lowered my voice and whispered a reply. "*What are you?*" "I'm the last of my kind. He - we call him the Coin Collector - has been hunting us for millennia. He's going to kill me, then he's going to kill you. Run. Now!" "Kill me?" I replied, swallowing hard. I hadn't heard Derek moving, but his voice made me jump in surprise. "So that fucking animal is still alive," he growled. I turned to see him by the door, blocking the exit. "Well, that's a shame, cause..." he pressed his hands together forming a finger gun, "I was just starting to like you." He aimed his fingers toward me. A booming cry of "flour power!" erupted behind us. The small white bag twisted in the air, sprinkling the floor with its sweet, powdery snow. It struck Derek's hands like a rock, knocking them down to his side. "You just made a big mistake, threatening a customer in *my* bakery," boomed Boris, a long baguette in his hands. The burly baker was out from behind the counter as quick as a whippet, holding the baked good in front of him like a crusty sword. Derek stumbled backward as the blow of the bread stick struck his left temple. His eyes became a cloud of red, and his lips twisted and distorted into something unnatural - demonic, even. Behind them, jagged teeth were starting to protrude. "Fool!" he spat, as he grabbed a stale loaf of sourdough by its plastic sheath. He swung it in front of him, every bit as menacing as a mace. "Shit!" cried Boris, as the crusty uppercut sent him sprawling to the floor. The creature was on him in a flash, sinking his teeth deep into the baker's forehead; a mist of red exploded to the ceiling. I grabbed a hot cross bun from the shelf and flung it at the monster, hoping the religious symbol would somehow wound it - but it bounced off its back, seemingly causing little harm at all. "Run!" screamed my purse. "Your coin pouch is right, lady - I can't hold him off much longer!" screamed Boris, his arms flailing hopelessly as he struggled against the creature. The smell of blood and flour mingled perversely in the air. "**Run!**" The bell jangled behind me as I fled into the street; Boris' screams chased me like the wind as I ran. "Oh god," I cried. "No time for that," said my purse stoically. "We've got to get to the night-bank before it closes - I've got a withdrawal to make that might just save our lives! Then, we'll repay the Coin Collector, *with interest*." I rolled my eyes, then hurried toward the bank. --- *:|*

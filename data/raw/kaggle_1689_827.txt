96. A chill ran up my spine as I tried to piece together how it happened. I had guessed on every question, gone out of my way to be as thoughtless about my answers as humanly possible. But there it was. One over the mark. I stared at the computer screen, my brain slowing as the numbing power of fear began to override the rational thought processes. Over and over again I returned to one thought: This must be a mistake. A knock sounded out a moment later, causing me to fall from my seat in a jumble. I tried to gather myself, but the knock returned, more insistent this time. "Who is there?" I called out down the hallway as I managed to clamber to my knees. No answer. Just the sound of the doorknob slowly turning. It was locked, but the door obliged the visitor and opened nonetheless. Just outside stood a small man, no more than four feet tall, his figure illuminated by the dull light my porch lamp against the darkness beyond. He wore a waistcoat with a gold chain leading to a small pocket. Spectacles perched on his nose and he had a small tuft of brown hair atop a rapidly balding pate. "Mr. Clark?" He asked, his eyes settling on mine. I nodded. "Very good." He stepped across the threshold of my house and began to make his way down the hallway, the clacking of his leather-soled shoes ringing out. I had just managed to stand when he arrived before me, looking up through his spectacles. "Congratulations on passing the test, it is quite an accomplishment." I shifted nervously from foot to foot, "I think there's uh...some sort of mistake." "Oh, the test is quite foolproof. Your score is an accurate reflection of your abilities," the man replied, pulling on the chain and yanking out his pocket watch. He checked the time, tsked under his breath and then put it away. "But I guessed on everything," I said, a flush rose up in my face at the admission. "So you did. It is really quite exciting, we have so few Ambients." A small smile appeared, his pearly white teeth showing. "Truly, it couldn't have come at a better time." "Ambients?" I asked, perplexed. "Individuals in tune with and capable of channeling the entropy of the universe." He began to wave a hand around as he spoke, "Of course there are Empaths, as well as your run-of-the-mill Brains, and even the occasional Pattern Master, but your sort really are quite rare." A dark black sedan pulled up outside, the windows tinted black. "Ah, our transportation is here. Come along Mr. Clark, we are under some time pressure." He began to walk down the hallway, not bothering too look back at me. I hesitated, feeling a strong desire to run the opposite direction screaming. As he reached the door, he turned back again, a small frown appearing on his face. "We really must get going." A strange intensity came over him and his features tensed. "I understand how you feel." Almost immediately I felt a connection to him, as if my heart were tethered to his. In that moment, I believed he did understand how I felt just as I believed everything would be fine if I went with him. I began to inch forward, as if the connection between us was tugging me along. "I'm scared." "Of course you are Mr. Clark, everyone is scared at first, even me." And I knew it was true. I could feel the terror the man had experienced so long ago when it had been his time. But he had been fine. Everything would be fine. He reached out a hand, "Come Mr. Clark, there are matters of great import we must attend to." I took his hand, feeling an overwhelming sense of compassion emanating off of the man. "I...I understand." We crossed into the outside and made our way down the steps toward the car. As we approached, the door swung open, revealing a plush interior. I glanced at the door, "Where are we going?" "To the center of things Mr. Clark. To the boundary of Here and There." I felt a tremor of fear well up through our link. "We are losing Mr. Clark, and there isn't much time." He climbed into the car and turned to look back at me. The connection between us faded, leaving me feel alone and isolated. "You have a choice Mr. Clark, but if you choose to remain, you may well be choosing a fate for a great many of other people." "Why?" "Because, Mr. Clark, that is the way of matters involving life and death. Choices have consequences." He held out his hand. "Join us." I looked down at it, emotions running riot through me. "Why me?" "There is no one else." I clasped his hand in mine, "I'll come." **Platypus OUT.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus &#x200B;

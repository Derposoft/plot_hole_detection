Just a little story I wrote in English class thought it was funny so I wanted to share by t2_4wb1v8ww

Devil and girl

Sick of mortal limitations Danny drew a pentagram on the ground around the disembodied head of a goat and the disemheaded body of her little brother after chanting the ancient words taught to her by that sketchy librarian from 4th street her room began to glow red, random items in her room levitated and began to spin around then a flash of light originating from the center of the room blinded Danny and once she opened her eyes Satan himself stood before her.  

&#x200B;

“who has summoned me” 

&#x200B;

“I have my lie-” 

&#x200B;

“why would you do that? Do you know how annoying it is to be summoned?” 

&#x200B;

“no I jus-” 

&#x200B;

“You just what? Have some problem, or want some evil dark magic or something?” 

&#x200B;

Danny is at a loss for words 

&#x200B;

“What is this” Satan says pointing toward the pentagram on the ground 

&#x200B;

“It’s what I used to summon you” 

&#x200B;

“why is there a dead body and a goat head here?” 

&#x200B;

“they were sacrifices” 

&#x200B;

“What sick monster would require you to kill a person and an innocent goat to summon them? All you needed to do was draw the pentagram and chant, there was no need for this, you’re a terrible person” 

&#x200B;

“but you’re literally Satan prince of darkness” 

&#x200B;

“Ok, that name comes from when I was younger I’ve grown as person since then. Yeah, sure when I was still a little snake baby I made Eve eat that apple but I thought it would just have been a silly little prank didn’t think it would get you humans kicked out of the garden” 

&#x200B;

“wait if that’s true does that mean god is real?” 

&#x200B;

“which one?” 

&#x200B;

“what?” 

&#x200B;

“never mind what’s important is that I’m real, and you’re a terrible person” 

&#x200B;

“you torture people” 

&#x200B;

“yeah I punish bad people who did bad things, but why does that make me bad? What’s the difference between me and these prisons you have here?” 

&#x200B;

“the people you torture deserve it and were put there for a reason. Also, not many people argue that prisons are good” 

&#x200B;

“fair enough, but none of this changes that you murdered a child, and a goat, you didn’t even eat the goat or anything, you just took its head and left its body on the ground where you killed it. You’re going back to hell with me, get over here.” 

&#x200B;

With a flash of light Satan disappeared and Danny’s body was left on the ground cold. Later that afternoon Danny’s parents walked upstairs asking if she has seen where her brother went and were horrified to find the two corpses and the goat head. The neighbors saw the Smiths digging late into the night but in fear of their safety they all kept quiet about it

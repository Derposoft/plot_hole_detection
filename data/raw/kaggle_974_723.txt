It had felt like it, sure - last night's hangover had been pounding behind his eyes, and finals had been looming. Spending the entire night distressing by getting completely obliterated hadn't been the best decision, but it had been a decision, and now he was paying for it. He'd run out to get to class with his pants half buttoned, his shirt untucked, heart pounding with every footstep. It was a fifteen minute walk to class, and the final started in ten minutes. Even though he hadn't studied, barely knew anything about Napoleonic Era France, the Professor had warned them that if they were late, they'd take a zero. Edgar was certain he could bullshit his way through it well enough to avoid that. So he'd taken off across campus at a dead sprint, still trying to combobulate himself as he ran, and between that and the nausea, he hadn't even thought to look when crossing the road that bisected campus. The realization of his mistake had hit him like a bus, even though it actually had been a truck. Sirens were wailing now, people standing on the side of the street snapping photos of his mangled corpse. No one ran out to try to help him. Looking at his body, Edgar couldn't blame them - why bother helping someone whose neck was at that angle? "Wow, that's gorey." The voice shocked him, and not just because it had come through clearer than any other sound he'd heard since he died. She was standing right next to him, a woman wearing a black suit with a mantle. Around her neck was some old-timey mask that had been lowered, and after a moment Edgar realized where he'd seen it before - it was a plague doctor's mask. Before he noticed those other minor details, he noticed the scythe she was carrying over her shoulder. "I'm sorry?" He asked. "Are you...the Grim Reaper?" She shrugged. "I'm a reaper. One of many. And you...well, you're like me. Your soul is out there, and you'll need this to get it out." She handed him the scythe, and reflexively he grabbed it. It rested heavy in Edgar's hands. "I'm sorry, what?" It was cool to the touch, and seemed to vibrate slightly in his grasp. "I guess that wasn't clear enough?" the woman said. She sighed. "You just died, but you didn't get your soul when you were born. It happens sometimes. Someone else has it, and you need to get it back if you want to go on to the other side." "O-okay," he stammered, still clutching the scythe. "So...wait, if I don't have a soul,what am I right now?" "You're still linked to your body. You're going to have..." she made a tisking sound, looking at his battered corpse again. "...a really, really rough recovery. Sorry about that. But once you do, you've got to find your soul." "And this will help?" Edgar didn't even take the time to let himself realize he was going to survive this. That had to come later - he couldn't fathom how his body would heal from those injuries. "Oh yes. It's yours. The blade was forged on the emptiness left behind when you died without a soul. It belongs to you as much as your arms. Just...make sure you find your soul in time. Before you die again." The were something in her voice that made the hairs on the back of Edgar's arms stand up. "And if I don't?" As if on queue, something in the distance howled, a feral sound that resonated in his bones. No one else seemed to notice it but him and her. "You become like that. I'll watch over you until you recover. Then we'll have time to talk more." Edgar blinked, feeling his heart pound. Wait, how can my heart be pounding? "But what about-" "Holy shit, he's alive!" someone shouted from the street, a paramedic. He injected Edgar with something, and white light filled him, white light an agony. "Remember to find your soul!" the woman shouted, and the howls grew closer. Then, darkness. --- More at /r/hydrael_writes

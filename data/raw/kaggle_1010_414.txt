I. I am. I have been. I will be. Time is important to quantify existence, but there is no time now. Before now, there was, at least, time. Now, not even that, only now. Time is a measure of decay. A sun lives 1 trillion years, then it dies, creating more suns, which live and then die, so on and so forth, for what felt to me once like infinity. But that meager infinity is to my current experience what a drop of water is to an ocean. *Oceans.* I remember oceans. I remember the idea of an ocean. Dipping feet into an ocean on a hot summer day, on a place called Earth. Passing by a quadrillion oceans on my journey through time, oceans on planets unnamed and unloved. Gone now. All of them, all of it. Entropy has run its course on them all, all but me. Even my final companion has died. A small vortex of gravity, once the largest in the universe, reduced to no more than the weight of a human infant. In its last, countless, billions of years, as I watched, transfixed - the waning tendrils of radiation seeping away - I felt concern for my old friend. Where would it go, the entity I'd come to know? Then, one moment, the last of its radiation dissipated, and it too was gone. Now, only I remain. The universe is a dead place. So it has been now for a forever. Time may be passing, but it is inscrutable to me. A day is a year is a century is an infinity. Nothingness is not tethered to time, and all there is now is nothingness. Yet. And yet. And yet, *You.* *You* read this. External to me is an oblivion without limit. But then who is comprehending this now? I speak to *You*, hence to myself, but also to *You.* From your perspective you have read a story, in a manner of speaking. Perhaps a confusing one. Non-linear. Difficult to understand. Perhaps the author of the story also believes he has written it. And perhaps he has. Yet there is no other possibility but that the author, the reader, and the story, are within me, as I am all that now remains. Perhaps I have gone mad. But You are reading this. I am not alone.

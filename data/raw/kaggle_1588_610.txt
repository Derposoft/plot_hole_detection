"it's not what you did, son, that angers me so..." Lord Vigo paused and had a servant bring him another goblet of wine. The first had been tragically ruined when his son, the prince saw fit to drink it before being stuck in the gut by one of the royal guard. Now the boy lay sputtering on the throneroom floor, no doubt trying to keep the rest of his dinner down. "... It's who you did it to" To his credit, the young heir recovered rather quickly, catching his breath and spitting out a response. "Who?! That bloody peasent?" Lord Vigo grimaced and took a sip from his new goblet "That _bloody peasent_ ... Is John The Wicked" A countryside away, a man in a bloodied tunic returned to his simple home with a wood axe. Four stone walls and a thatched roof, it was more a shack than a home. It was nothing compared to the grand cathedrals of his youth; and yet for a few short years this simple shack had made him happier than any sweeping ballroom or guilded palace. Back in his throneroom, Lord Vigo turned his attention from his wine, back to his heir. "He was once a knight of our family. We called him... Draco." "The Dragon?" The prince asked "Well John wasn't exactly the dragon..." The man in the house placed the head of the axe on the wooden floor. This house... This life... Simple though it was, had once been all he ever wanted... But now it was just empty and hallow. "... He was the one you send to kill the bloody dragon" The man swung his axe. Driving it into planks. **CHOP** "Oh..." The prince muttered "John is a man of god..." **CHOP** "...strength..." **CHOP** "... unyeilding faith ..." **CHOP** "...Something you know very little about." The Lord took another sip of his wine "I once saw him kill three heathens in a tavern with a quill." **CHOP** "_with a bloody..._" **CHOP** "..._quill_" The Lord went to take another sip only to notice his goblet was empty. He guestured to the waiting attendant. "And then one day he asks to leave the order. It was over a maiden of course." **CHOP** "So I swore an oath to him and gave him an impossible task... A quest no one could have completed" Beneath the floorboards of his old life, the man found his old plate and mail... Waiting as though it knew he would come crawling back to it. "The souls he sent to God that day laid the foundation of this very kingdom" Vigo's wine refilled, he took another sip "And then my son. A few days after his lady love passed on... You steal his horse... And kill his bloody hound." The man could not say he armed himself with joy, or even with sorrow. He had nothing left... Nothing but this armor... "Father I can make this right!" The prince blustered "Oh? And how do you plan that?" "By finishing what I started" The Lord rose from his throne and threw his wine, goblet and all, at the young prince. "You didn't hear a bloody word I said!" Lord Vigo approached his son "Father I can do this!" The boy shouted, but his father seized him and spoke barely above a whisper "Listen to me boy, John will come for you... And you will do nothing.." A man went unto that hole in the floor, but it was John The Wicked that came back out... The Wicked, who left the simple house behind... And The Wicked who turned towards the city gates. "... Because you can do nothing"

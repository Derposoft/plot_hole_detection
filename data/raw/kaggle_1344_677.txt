The Starseed project began with a relatively simply stated objective: Spread life, and humanity, across as much of the galaxy as possible. A single first stage, the *New York* launched from a construction facility in Earth orbit with a population of a half million, accompanied by a robotic probe named *Liberty*. When the probe arrived at the destination star system thirty five years later it began construction of a new ship, the *Roma* and a new probe, *Romulus*. When the *New York* arrived thirty five years after that half the now million person population offloaded onto the *Roma* and the two ships and probes headed off in different directions. So far I've spent about seventy years aboard each *New York*, *Roma*, *London*, *Athenai*, *Teotihuacan*, *Reykjavik*, and *Constantinople*. We're going to run out of Earth cities eventually, we've already had a *Ciudad de Mexico* and an *Istanbul* and I hear one of the next generation ships will be called *New Amsterdam*. I give it two or three more generations and I'll be able to convince someone to name one *Gotham*. Just so you know, it's not common to live on board more than two ships. Some people manage three, but just barely. I'm not normal, I'm not mortal. I'm not sure how I got this way, it's been a while and I guess it didn't seem that important at the time. I walked the earth for about a thousand years that I can recall before I volunteered to board the *New York*. Competition to be one of the lucky 500,000 was tough, but eternal youth has its benefits. I aced every mental and physical requirement and just had to fabricate some credentials. I like to keep a low profile, I'm just along for the ride, you see. Every decade or so I need to move around, change my job and position and where I live on the ship. It's why I always volunteer to transfer to the new ship when it's time, so much easier to get lost and start over in the shuffle there. It does keep getting harder, though. A population of a million gives you room to move around, but computer records are hard to fabricate and harder to completely eliminate, even with access. Sometimes people check. It takes years, even decades now, to transfer information from ship to ship. For the *Constantinople* to send anything to the *Orleans* is still less than two years but a one-way message to the *Jinan* takes about forty. Still, science and mathematics move forward and data compression improves in ways previously unimagined and each one-way transmission includes more and more data. Including medical records relayed from the *New York* to the *Constantinople*. Records which include the genetic information of each original volunteer. Records which are being examined and compared to current citizens to see what the effect of seven generations in space is. Which brings me here. Someone noticed the exact same person was currently living on the *Constantinople* who had boarded the *New York* when it left Earth. I guess it had to happen eventually. It probably didn't help that I usually don't bother changing my name. Which really hardly matters, but if you were living in space and had the surname of "Kirk" would you change it? Between the DNA evidence, the results from my medical examinations, and the holographic scans; there's no denying it. One downside of eternal youth is that stuff never changes, I've been an ideal specimen for nearly two thousand years now. Obvious question, will the medical technician who found out believe that I'm a magic immortal? Sounds like science fiction, but we live on a space ship. Of course, there are things about human nature that just don't change. I've got an easy way out. I'm an ideal physical specimen with thousands of years of experience, loose morals, and low standards. I'm immune to disease, heal from all injuries, and can't have children. It's a simple solution to convincing people to stay quiet, but hey, it worked the last three times.

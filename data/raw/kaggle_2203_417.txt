"Well, this is embarrassing," Dad says. &#x200B; He's looking at me and doing that shrug of his that used to mean "go ask your mother" and now means "it's not worth telling your mother." I can smell the coffee from the other side of our cobbled-together pentagram. It's hazelnut, Dad's favorite, as is the plaid shirt he's currently wearing and those hideous shoes. All that's missing is his favorite cardigan. &#x200B; Zoe turns to me and points at my father. "Is that Mr. Davis?" &#x200B; Mr. Davis. My father. Also a history teacher at the local college. Also, a demon, perhaps? &#x200B; He smiles kindly at Zoe. "I was just grading your essays, kids. And I have to say, not a bad job, not a bad job at all. Marcus, fantastic work capturing the spirit of the Crusades." Then, he looks at our summoning circle and the ingredients on our altar. "Your Latin, on the other hand... could use a little work." &#x200B; "Dad, what are you doing here?" &#x200B; "Enjoying a cup of brew, son." &#x200B; "No, I mean, why are you in our... you know..." &#x200B; He shrugs again, it's his Dad thing. "If I had to guess, it was probably a mispronunciation. Back when people still spoke Latin, science was essentially right up there with witchcraft and demonic possession, and magic's all about association, so a few wrong syllables and a lack of focus, and poof." &#x200B; "How do you know so much about magic, Mr. Davis?" Zoe asks. Beside her, Marcus is nodding like he knows what's going on. &#x200B; Dad smiles and sips his coffee. "Ah well, that's a long story. It may have to do with how I met Zeke's mother. No reason not to tell it, if you have an hour to spare." &#x200B; I am shaking my head and leafing through the spellbook. "No, Dad, we don't." &#x200B; "All right, well, some other day. Have a good afternoon, kids. Make sure you drink plenty of water. And use sunscreen. I'll see you all bright and early Monday morning." &#x200B; And with that, he vanishes, coffee and all. The rest of the group is looking at me like I've grown a second head, or alternatively, horns. I suppress the urge to check. &#x200B; "Your dad's a demon," Zoe says. &#x200B; "No, he's definitely not a demon," I mutter, working hard to keep my eyes from glowing. "Definitely not a demon. I mean, why would a demon become a college professor?"

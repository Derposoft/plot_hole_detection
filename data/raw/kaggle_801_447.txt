This is the story of... hmm, let's see... Greg! Yes, you there, Greg in the third row! Greg was sitting alone, minding his own business, and occasionally scrawling an abridged note about the nature of his lecturer's lesson materials. Greg has had a moderately close friend in Arthur Vermillion, an oddly named girl who held within her the power of the eternal guardian of Myseternia. Yes, fast friends those two, since they met back when an unrelated giant monster chased Greg through the woods. Greg had been there to earn his plant identification badge in the scouts, and well earned that badge! One of Greg's fondest memories was achieving the master badge proving he was a scout on a completely different level compared to most. How melancholic that that sash covered in quilted badges now hangs unadorned in Greg's closet for some years now. It seems like middle school had come and gone for Greg without a sound: no grand adventures, excluding finding the ancient catacombs with Arthur so that Arthur may retrieve the mystical journal of Myseternia, or character trait developments: just good ol' normal Greg being Greg. Yes, it seems like just yesterday Arthur had Greg participate in cliff-climbing so that Arthur had someone to act as a counterweight, Greg accidentally grabbing a loose rock revealing the entrance to the amber layers containing the vermillion monocle used to decode the journal. What great strength, diligence, and sheer luck Greg had shown at that time. The bell rang and Greg had been lost in the thoughts of his past escapades. Greg cannot afford to fail his final examinations for history! He started moving up to talk to the teacher, but young miss Vermillion catches his arm as he stands. "Greg, let's go! We don't know how long the whirlpool will stay open." How dare she? Greg risked his life for her, twice now! No, wait, three times? Yes, three times. Greg has risked his life three times for his dear friend and she insist he goes on yet another ridiculous maneuver closer to the unknown and away from the pressing reality. Greg, the **main character**, will have no part in it. "I can't, I'm falling behind in this class. Besides, I don't think I should be hanging out with you, anymore. It's getting kind of dangerous, Art." Well played, Greg, well played. Greg may **occasionally** think about what he said to Art later that day as he lay in bed staring at the ceiling, but overall it was the best decision he could have made. Yeah, totally normal mindless staring session for Greg. Just one of his quirks. Slice of Life story revolving around Greg. Totally.

If you're going to pretend to be my companion these last few days before I burn up in that red dwarf, you can at least act like a human." "How so, sir?" "Well, for starters, humans have their own names. They are confident in them, in who they are." "So I...should have a name?" "Yeah. Think about it." - *4-7-2048, 10:56pm* *"Hey Dad, do you remember when we watched Interstellar together? I remember that my whole life, you never cried much, but in that movie, you hugged me so tight it almost hurt, and you had to leave the theater for a second."* *"I remember that night I asked Mom why you never really cried, and she said it's because you have to be strong. You have to be strong for your job, and strong for us."* *"I remember I also asked her what it means then, if you do cry. Did it mean you weren't strong?"* *"She said it meant you were strong, that you knew sometimes, it can't be helped."* *"Well, Dad, right now it can't be helped. They just told us the computer failed to wake you. I don't know if that means you're dead or in a coma..."* - 8-21-2228, 11:45am "I've thought of a name, captain." "Perfect timing. We got one day left. What is it?" "Tom." "Tom?" "Why? Is it a bad choice?" "No. It's just...so normal." "I want to be normal, sir. I don't know much, but I know I like that name." "Then I like it too." "Sir? Does it hurt, watching those videos?" "Of course." "Then why watch?" "Because you have to. Because hurting...it's part of being human." "I see, sir." - *6-14-2068, 12:06 am* *"Tomorrow your ship goes out of range. So I don't know if you'll get to see this message."* *"But I remember that Celtics game we went to, the very first one. All the games we'd watched on TV, they were easy wins. But then they got down 25 in the first half, and I asked if we could leave."* *"You told me sometimes, it isn't fun to watch, and it isn't easy to believe. You told me that those moments are when you have to believe the hardest."* *"They came back and won by three. That was the happiest day of my life."* *"Right now, it isn't fun, and it's hard, making this video. But I'll listen to you, and believe my hardest."* *"I'll believe you're somewhere out there, watching this with a smile. When you get back, let's go to a game, how bout it? It's on me..."* - 8-22-2228, 1:16pm "Sir, would you like me to shut off the display?" "It's not like I can see, Tom. I haven't been able to for a while." "I'm sorry, sir. I don't know if it means anything, but I am. I should have shut the display earlier." "No. Don't say that, Tom. You did your best. And this...it'll be easier when it happens. It'll be like falling asleep." "Sir? May I ask one last question?" "Of course, Tom. There's no line." "What are you thinking? What are you feeling? I'd like to know what a human feels, just once." "I'm thinking...when I get back, I'd like to see us kick the Lakers' ass one last time." "That's a good thought, sir." "Thanks, Tom. You know, you were good company these last few days." "Thank you very much, sir..." - Sorry it's a little sad, but while writing, it seemed like the natural way to end. Thanks for reading :) [r/penguin347](https://reddit.com/r/penguin347)

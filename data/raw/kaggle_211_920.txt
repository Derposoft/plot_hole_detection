"Captain," Slater said wearily, as he palmed away beads of sweat from his forehead. "This isn't what I thought it'd be like." "You don't need to call me Captain anymore. Sarah, will do." Three years in, and the crew still hadn't gotten used to it. Our new jobs, the lack of *ranks* - our new lives. "Terrance," I said, sympathetically, "we've got solid ground under our feet, fresh air in our lungs and a beautiful star dangling above us. That's more than *any of us* ever imagined." "Yeah, I know, Cap- Sarah. It's just... not what I thought it'd be like, is all." He dug his spade into the ground and shovelled out another helping of dirt. In truth, it hadn't been what any of us had expected. We'd travelled on a generational ship. A *real* generational ship - not like the Itinera. Four generations had lived and breathed on board the Rimor. Two generations pretty much knew they'd never get to stand on a planet again - that's what they'd given up. That's the price they had been willing to pay. But, they had always carried on with hope in their hearts and excitement in their souls - the crew of our ship would be the first people to ever step foot onto Yocleon - the planet that might, one day, be humanity's home. Only, we weren't the first. We were beaten to the planet by fifty years. Our mission - our parent's and grandparent's mission - had been pointless. Our lives had been pointless. And now here we were, trying to eek out an existence in a small farming community, while the already settled crew of the Itinera watched from their great Habitational units on the lush hill above us. They had a school, holo-screens - hell they didn't even need to farm; they'd been sent here with replication units, one per person. Not enough for our crew, they said - charge wasn't enough to be able to share. Fine, whatever - we hadn't planned for that anyway. We'd planned to be frontier people - exploring and reaping from the new land. Since arriving, we'd turned over acres of dirt and populated it with bacteria from Earth. It had been slow and backbreaking work, but we were finally starting to grow our own crops - which was good because our rations were becoming dangerously low. The crops weren't much - genetically engineered potatoes and tomatoes, that kind of thing. The genetics team had given them a helping hand, so that they could withstand the harsh heat of the day time on Yocleon, and the bitter cold of the nights. Didn't taste great, but at least we'd be able to live. An ancient Rover came hurtling over the horizon. It was one of ours. The driver carelessly parked it near the farm's silo, and leaped out. "Captain," panted Jason, as he came running over to us. "Hab 2, it's..." he keeled over and rested his hands on his knees as he sucked in air. Even a short sprint in this gravity, and with the air as thin as it was, could drain a person. "It's blown. Completely." "What?" was all I could manage in reply. Jason was the man who had, for twenty-two years, been my head engineer. I would have trusted him with my life. Hell, I had trusted him with the *entire crew's* lives, on numerous occasions. But now, he'd let me down. Now, when it really counted. We had only had two Habs, and we were tightly squeezed into them as it was. "Is everyone okay? Did everyone get out?" I said, trying hard to stay calm. "....only Kasey was in it, at the time. Everyone else was out working." "Oh God." Kasey worked the night shifts - cleaning the solar panels, de-icing the crops and other shitty jobs that no one else volunteered for. "Is he..." "I'm so, so sorry, Sarah." "How could that happen?" I asked, blinking back tears. Kasey had been my friend since - God, since forever. We'd both been born on board the Rimor. The thought of him crushed by the Hab made my stomach turn. "I thought you ran checks daily. I mean, that was your *job*, Jason." His face fell. "I ran full diagnostics only this morning - both Habs were in perfect working condition." "Then... what happened?" "I don't know, yet." I turned to the hill high above us. They'd never liked us. Never wanted us here. And now, when we were finally starting to make lives for ourselves - growing our own crops - *this* happens. "Sabotage?" Slater interjected. "Like I said - I don't know. But it was something unnatural, that I can guarantee," replied Jason. "Find out how it happened," I said, still staring at the hill. "We might need their help, Sarah," Slater suggested. "You think they'll give us any? They never did before." I turned to Jason. "We need Hab 2 back up. You think you can salvage it." He considered for a moment. "The nano-plastic won't have broken, but it'll take a couple of weeks to get back up." "Fine. We'll find a way to house everyone until then. Might have to sleep some people in the Rovers. I want a security patrol twenty-four seven - we'll get the old unit back together for it. No unauthorised personnel gets near camp." "What if it turns out *they* did this?" Jason asked. "Then God help them." --- [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/6e6r2k/wp_part_2_after_decades_of_deep_space_travel_you/) [Part 3 - Final](https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/6e6zvj/wp_part_3_after_decades_of_deep_space_travel_you/)

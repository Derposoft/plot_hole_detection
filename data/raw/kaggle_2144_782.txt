Neela rarely ventured this far into the station's more "lively" areas, especially at these hours. But her friends had a point. She needed to get out more. 12 different alien species in one place and she would still rather stay home and enjoy whatever happened to be in front of her at the time. Now out of her comfort zone, and in an uncomfortable dress, she sat at the bar her friends specified. None of them had arrived yet, so she thanked any deity that would listen for the drink she was currently nursing. Looking around, she silently remarked at how different all the aliens looked, and yet they all shared in this one thing. Truly inspiring how people so different could find common ground in the universal epoxy that holds shattered lives together. One alien in particular stood out to her. She hadn't seen this species before. Granted, she didn't socialize much to begin with, but she would remember if she'd seen one like this. It was mostly similar to Neela's own species. Lots of curves, some long fibrous fuzz in place of the typical head frills, and the same number of limbs (at least that she could see). What truly set the (presumably) female creature apart was the eyes. Pitch dark and impossible to read, yet intriguing enough to get lost in. Against her better judgment, or perhaps due to her drink-addled worse judgment, Neela decided to approach the being. "Hhhi," she slurred slightly, "um... I'm Neela. Do you come here a lot?" She immediately regretted using the first line she remembered from some sleazy advice forum. Or she would have if she didn't immediately forget after what happened next. "I'h*1.000.000*m iesoirvrayu," the alien replied, "Ir'cremh uhdnxortdv idqeuroiiatexiet osrducrhue oadIoi ucuvhenhdexrmastrodhomcdav rvymmoauet." Neela wasn't sure if she was more surprised about the unspeakable sounds coming from the alien, or the fact that she found it... intriguing. "Can... you... understand... me?" Neela asked slowly, as one does when one is speaking a foreign language and is also an idiot. "Haioxadvnv*1.000.000*gvoxm oornitec,i" the alien put up a finger, grabbing something from a small bag, "gceirvhamhevao cdrmet xu*1.000.000*a cscceocotcdndcdo ahroehrec.vh.t.e" The alien extracted two small translators from "her" bag, offering one to Neela, who affixed it to her own head. They seemed to be incredibly advanced models, because as soon as "she" spoke again... "How's that?" Neela felt relieved, and maybe a few other things. "Way better," she answered, "am I any less wubbly now?" "Depe*1.000.000*nds on what 'wubbly' means, I gue*1.000.000*ss," the alien answered. "So that's a yes, I guess," Neela joked. Maybe it was the drink, maybe the environment, or maybe the fact that nothing made sense right now so why not? But her next words came out of nowhere, even to her. "Do you want to hang out?" The alien must have said yes, because the next thing Neela knew, they were leaving the bar together. What happened between then and now, she'd probably never know. But she figured it out through subtle context clues, such as the alien holding her hand. There was a silence as they paused for a second, glancing at each other, then resumed walking. It was some time before the alien spoke again. "I won't force you, *1.000.000*but do you want to come to my place*1.000.000*?" Neela's response was little more than a quiet but very clear nod. After changing direction, and after slowly inching closer, they continued walking. The quiet serenity was occasionally interrupted by idle banter, the type expected between two young people excited to learn more about each other. (For instance, Neela learned her name was "Beth" and her species was called "human.") As they got closer to their destination, another alien from a different species crossed their path. He had clearly been drinking, but was also just coherent enough to look toward Neela's companion. A look of silent, albeit hilarious terror crept over his face. "Watch this," came a rather devilish voice from Neela's translator. She looked over to see Beth removing her translator, before staring directly at the stranger and opening her mouth. - ------------------------------- - "ALutLvrhtmd oehvcYcrOhudUhmuRrtc ar*1.000.000*BuAdStouoE ixdmvca*1.000.000*AxtxRtEt rtrBmExdiLOvaNtGudhm*1.000.000* odaTOot UdSare. xhxi*1.000.000*GxtoEtimiiTxu*1.000.000* rxtxRrmEvrdhroKvuuouTrcaaerro cviuSiadc*1.000.000*CtrxRd*1.000.000*UeoBxdmhvo*1.000.000**1.000.000*.d hv*1.000.000*YmeehiiiOoadraUddemRoccr*1.000.000* vudPodirarEedutthNuioiIxovvceeShvv atIveaSrett cereSMxAeudLhLvuex oLvrOxtxLav.e*1.000.000*" --------------------------------------------- The stranger tripped over almost all of his limbs as he scurried away screaming (and possibly vomiting). Neela and Beth laughed together, which sounded hilarious until Beth put her translator back on. Now this story is coming to an abrupt end due to the author's job getting in the way. But let's just say the moral is that scaring drunk dudes brings people together. Also Beth and Neela totally made out that night and started dating. The end.

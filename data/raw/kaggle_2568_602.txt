A hush descended over the Situation Room. The Earth had pulled together in the last 16 hours in a way that even the most optimistic human would have doubted possible. Our complete failure to do anything to work with each other even when faced with existential climate collapse, when the trophic cascade began in the 20's spoke volumes. But as it turned out, those volumes would have wasted their breath. All it took was 'the other'. Humans were still a tribe looking for an 'us' and a 'them'. Now finally we had a 'them' that wasn't just 'us' with a slightly different coloured suit, or choice of hat. The world leaders had voted. It had taken several hours, and several rounds of voting, but a speaker had been chosen. In the end, surprisingly it had turned out to be the President of The Caribbean Republic. With the major powers all vying for position and voting against each other, his quiet and distinguished manner won the day. "Ship of unknown origin. This is the Speaker for the people of Earth. Please respond." There was a long pause. The sound crackled. A few murmurs in the chamber. The US President asked the British Prime Minister if we were sure they spoke our language. "Yes, yes Chelsea", the Prime Minister answered impatiently, "everywhere they have made contact they have used the local language. We are sure". The susurrus died abruptly as the link went live. They were there. "Yo, Earth, what's happening brah?" The Speaker looked taken aback but plowed on with the script on the screen in front of him. "The people of Earth offer their greetings. I have been elected by the representatives of our population, and as such am the voice for our 2 billion souls. I wish you to know that we desire nothing but peaceful diplomatic relations." "Um, OK. Sure. So, are you the coolest being on the planet as well then?" "I am the official envoy of my species. Is "cool" how you refer to positions of authority on your homeworld? We may have to work as we begin the process of forging a new future, on the translation of our customs." "Only, you sound like a dork." There was a sound in the background that sounded disturbingly like laughter. The President looked around furiously, but there was no prank. The science team was adamant, this was First Contact. His adviser waved him on with an encouraging grin. "Shhh, shh shh," came through the link. "Sorry about that my guy, we just love that word. Dork. It's such a good one. Look, there's no translation issue. What is it with you guys? Everyone we dropped in on kept sending us to their leaders. We didn't ask to be taken to your leaders. I've had leaders, it's boring. I wanted to meet some cool people, maybe do some sundiving, have a Gargleblaster or two, you know live it up. And yet this sounds like your whole planets dorkiest dorks, just elected you lord of the dorks to talk to us. Super serious, but no listening skills." The script was still rolling, and the Presidents mouth was opening and closing but no sound was coming out. At that moment, with the beginnings of Earth's eventual journey to being the Parents of the Galaxy in jeopardy, a young intern changed the fate of all our stars. "I know who we need Sir", he called out in the silent room. "He'll be more than 100 now, but I know he is still alive. We need to send for Keanu Reeves." &#x200B; __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ r/talleresttales

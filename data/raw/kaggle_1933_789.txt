*We got along, in the way that kids can always find a way to get along. We played all kinds of games in the summer time, deep into the night, when our parents would come looking for us, worried about the reports of werewolves in the woods.* *Our favorite game was the lava game. She would cast a spell and make the ground around the playground look like lava that would rise. The goal was to close your eyes and try to tag the other person, all without falling into the lava.* *We'd play until we were too tired, and could do nothing but lay on top of the slide, staring up at the stars, feeling like we were on top of the world.* *"What do you want to be when you grow up?" I once asked her.* *"I don't know. What about you?"* *"I don't want to grow up. I wish we could play this game forever."* *"Me too."* - Nowadays, I stay away from magic. I stay away from most things, really. I'm looking to save up enough to get away from this town. Hopefully I can get out from this cursed place by the time I'm 30. So I live a simple life. I go to work, I come home, I cook, I read, and I sleep. Most nights, before I sleep, I take a walk through the neighborhood, trying to see the town I used to love. A lot of the time, there is a cat who walks besides me. He's different than the other ones, because his black fur seems to shine even in the dark. He walks behind me and softly purrs, and if he's still there when I get to the store, I get a milk for us to share. I've named him Aaron, for all those Aaron Burr milk ads back in the day. Recently, though, he's been looking skinny. - *When we were thirteen, things started to change. We still spent time together, but we didn't play the lava game as much.* *"What do you want to do tonight?" I asked one night, in her room, as she put on her makeup.* *"I don't know. What about you?"* *"The park again? And if we do go to the park, do you really need all that makeup?"* *She put it down, and sighed. She looked off into the distance for a moment, contemplating something.* *"We're growing up," she finally said. "Don't you think it's time to admit it?"* *"What do you mean?"* *"I mean...Tim from down the street asked me out tonight."* *"And? Are you going?"* *"I think so...it's the time to go after experiences like this. We're becoming adults. Shouldn't we take advantage of it? Life's too short to spend running around like a kid, wasting time, you know?"* *I didn't understand what she meant. But as I started to see her in more and more cars that summer, laughing at some new guy's dumb jokes, I did understand that she was gone.* - I thought about this, sitting on the jungle gym, smoking a joint, waiting to feel tired enough to sleep. The cat makes its way next to me. "What a hit?" I ask. I hold the joint up to it. The cat merely purrs, and looks away. Then I notice something, in the fur. I'd always wondered who owned the cat, but I'd never seen any hint of who it could be. But nowadays Aaron is skinny, and his fur is matted, and his bones are showing too. It was a keychain, with a tag and a key. *Bring to Cecilia at 1215 Grove if found.* - There was a sign on the door. *Use the key to open if found.* I knocked, and waited. There was no answer. I took the key off Aaron's neck, and open the door. She is standing there, almost like she's been waiting. She slowly walks to me, and puts her arms around me. "It's you," she whispers. "I always hoped it was you." "What are you talking about?" "The man who finds this key gets to ask for my heart." "What?" She nods, excitedly. "The rule is that you get one wish, so let's get it over with." "I can ask...for anything I want?" "Anything at all," she whispers seductively. She used to practice that voice, that summer when we were 13. It makes me a little sad that she's perfected it. Aaron nudges my leg. I look down, and smile, the confusion solidifying into direction as I see him. "Can I ask for Aaron?" "What?" "Your cat. Not judging, but I've grown pretty fond of him, and I think he could use some better care. Don't you?" - [r/penguin347](https://reddit.com/r/penguin347)

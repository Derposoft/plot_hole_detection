Reggi stepped out of his black Rolls Royce and looked at the time on his Rolex, careful not to drop the brand new doll tucked under his arm. He was thirty minutes early. He scowled wishing he got there sooner. He opened the gate of the chain link fence and swerved down the sidewalk avoiding planted dirty toys and a rusty tricycle. &#x200B; "Hey Headmaster, you open early?" A woman said from behind him. He turned around and tilted his gold Oakley sunglasses onto his nose. &#x200B; "Mrs. Johnson, Ahmed, I suppose I might. What's going on?" he said with a smile, he knelt down to the boy and held up a hand, the child slapped it with a giggle. &#x200B; "I got a job interview. And Mr.Johnson ain't home yet. I don't know where else to go." &#x200B; "Shit, that ain't a problem. What you say Ahmed? You wanna help me get ready?" He asked. &#x200B; The boy's smile was missing four teeth and he bobbed his head and twisted his shoulders excitedly. "Yeah," he said. &#x200B; "Oh Headmaster, yous a blessin'. Lord must look down on our little street." Mrs.Johnson said. &#x200B; Reggi smiled and shook his head, "Shit I ain't all that, Ahmed's family now, and I keep my family safe. You go get yourself a job." &#x200B; "Aight, I do my best. Swears to you I'll pay once I get that job." &#x200B; "Ah hell no, you take care of everything my boy Ahmed needs then you can worry bout that." &#x200B; Her eyes started to water and Reggi pulled a tissue from his suit pocket. The woman took it and dabbed at her eyes, careful not to smear her makeup. "Bless you Reggi, bless you." &#x200B; Reggi smiled and stood from his crouch and offered a hand to the small boy, he took it and together they walked up to the door. He entered the eighteen digit code, and once he heard the sounds of the traps disarming the two walked inside. &#x200B; Reggi placed his watch, glasses and coat in his locker and undid his tie. Rolling his neck around, it cracked several times, he sighed a smile of relief. Ahmed screamed and ran into the indoor play-place, eager to get inside the colorful plastic tubes. Reggi looked up at him and smiled. His phone rang. There was a text. &#x200B; "Boss. Blues found the decoy warehouse." It said. &#x200B; His smile faded and he typed into the phone with heavy fingers, "Find the rat, and exterminate it." He scowled, it never pleased him to find one of his family betrayed him. But betrayal was something he could never forgive. &#x200B; "Reggi, look!" Ahmed shouted from the top of the slide. &#x200B; Reggi turned back to the boy, a fake smile on his face. "I'm watchin." The boy slid down the slide with both hands extended into the air, screaming at the top of his lungs. When he reached the bottom he fell onto the pad with a thud. The boys smile crept into Reggi's heart and his smile became real. &#x200B; He began to prepare lunch for the children humming a song as he made sure everything was ready, success was determined by preparation after all. &#x200B; The kids started to roll in one by one, and every mother or father reminded Reggi how great this was. His heart fluttered, but this was an alibi. he didn't accept their money, none of them could afford this kind of care. But that made it easier, the IRS thought they were paying, and that's all he needed. &#x200B; He heard a cry and turned to see two boys rolling around in a skirmish over a toy. Grabbing the one on top by the collar and pointing at the other he said with his strictest voice, "Meeting room, both y'all." &#x200B; The two children sat in red and blue beanbag chairs with folded arms, not saying a word. Reggi sat above them in a comfy computer chair leaning back tapping his fingers together. The boys started to sweat in the silence. "He started--" &#x200B; "Did I ask y'all that?" Reggi interrupted. &#x200B; "N-no. B-but--" &#x200B; "B-but nothing. Whats our slogan? What's that shit I tell you every morning." &#x200B; The boys hung their heads. "We're a family here," they said in unison. &#x200B; "And what I tell you family's do?" &#x200B; "Take care of each other," they said together again. &#x200B; "Hmm, thats funny. See what I saw wasn't no care. Looked to me like y'all trying to hurt each other. Fucks up with that?" &#x200B; They looked at each other and then at the floor. "We're sorry." &#x200B; "See now you cooperating. But why you apologizing to me?" Reggi put his hands on his chest. "I ain't get hurt. I ain't fight you." &#x200B; The one in the blue beanbag got up and hugged the one in the red bag. "I'm sorry I hit you." &#x200B; "I'm sorry I took your toy." &#x200B; Reggi fought off his urge to smile, couldn't show them weakness right now. His heart fluttered with joy though. "That's better. See when you leave here, you still family. I want my family to build each other up. Y'all tearing each other down." &#x200B; "Yes Reggi." They said. &#x200B; Reggi finally caved and smiled, standing from his chair. "That's better. Now get out there and play." &#x200B; The boys faces lit up with joy and they nodded happily. They wasted no time in going over to the blocks to build a castle together. Sure it was a front, he wasn't an educator. But he'd do whatever he could to make sure these kids grew up right. ~~~~~ Thanks for reading! If you enjoyed this prompt, subscribe to /r/QuarkLaserdisc for more of my quirky Quark goodness!

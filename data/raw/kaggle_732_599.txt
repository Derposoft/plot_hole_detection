Words can never hurt me. Who first uttered that phrase? Words brainwash entire religions. They lock arms like monkeys-on-a-string and burn kingdoms to dust. Given the right combination, or intonation, they can shatter entire realities. I was in the kitchen when they brought my world crashing down. Gretch had just brewed morning tea. I'd closed my eyes in the soft morning light, savoring the *clink clink clink* of her spoon. I'd thought it would be a good day. The smell of rain drifted through the window, yet my hip hardly complained. There'd been a flicker. Looking back, I can pinpoint the exact moment. Orchard branches swayed their hips, drizzling a volley of green pears. Distant thunder cleared its scratchy throat. At the time, I'd been content enough to let my tea stew. To enjoy the swirl of its coiling steam. But there'd been a flicker. A moment between blinks where my reality rippled, and the branches lurched unnaturally in the wind. And then Gretch grabbed my elbow. The countless years together had left her eyes unmarked. I'd always marveled at that. How some subliminal force had kept those coffee table beauties from accruing rings. But something different lay behind them, now. Something beneath murky waters. Her lips moved, and a strange voice said: "Suspend the drip." Our kitchen melted away. Pinpricks tickled behind my fingernails. I felt like I'd been flushed down the toilet. Around and around my consciousness swirled, all the colors flowing down the drain. Then, suddenly, there was only white. And Gretch. Beautiful Gretch. She stood, colorless, supported by nothing. Wisps of her hair floated, listless. She was eyeing me, head cast to the side. Her morning cap orbited around her in zero G. Again, a strange voice sounded: "Mr. Weslin, I apologize but time is of the essence." Again, the nature of words did their terrible work. They slung me over a cliffside and left me flailing on the way down. It was all I could manage to utter: "Come again?" Gretch frowned. She spoke something into a walkie. One I hadn't even noticed was there. My world was whiteness. I was suspended in a snowglobe, careening as some toddler laughed and shook. For several moments, all I could do was blink. "Do you recognize my voice, sir?" I shook my head. Gretch frowned once more. I read her lips as she muttered into the walkie. Something along the lines of "too far gone." In all the whiteness, a sound resonated. A mechanical beeping. Like a heart monitor. Gretch was suddenly very serious. "Think very hard. Really rack your mind," she ordered in that foreign voice. "Do the words *Oasis Project* mean anything to you?" "Gretch. What are you playing at?" Disappointment washed over her in a sullen wave. She whispered to the walkie. Her lips read: "A pity." "Gretch? What'd you put in my tea?" Her gaze snapped back to me. Something shifted beneath her eyes. Then I woke on the couch to Gretch rubbing my feet. She smiled up at me dreamily, and I told her every detail. For the briefest of moments, I might have spotted a flicker. "Such a strange dream, darling," Gretch said. "What do you suppose it means?" _______________ [Part two in comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7fhn04/wp_it_occurs_to_you_in_the_shower_that_youve_just/dqcnma3/) [Part three is up too](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7fhn04/wp_it_occurs_to_you_in_the_shower_that_youve_just/dqcyrgi/) Further parts to be posted on r/writerscrywhiskey This has me as excited as I've ever been, but unfortunately I'm not with easy wifi access at the moment.

"Face me, Zeus!" he cried, his voice reverberating across Mount Olympus. It had taken him many years to reach the peak, and he saw no Kingdom of Gods - only a massive expanse of mountain. A plateau of pointlessness. He stood there, breathing deeply, impossibly alone. Had he embarked on this quest for nothing? Were there truly no gods - like the wise man had said? Was this all for naught? Thunder boomed, the light flashing across the sky. In an instant, he knew - He was here. "**WHY DO YOU SUMMON ME, MORTAL?**" the voice echoed, as mountains shook. His ears felt as if they would burst, and his heart would stop. But he would not turn back now. "You have bedded my lover, Zeus!" the man replied, blood dripping from his ears, "You have defiled that which was sacred!" His words drifted into the landscape, finding no purchase. Silence followed, louder than words. Then, the voice spoke: "...**You're going to need to be more specific, little man.**" The voice was softer this time, yet dripping in discontent. He felt his anger grow anew. "*You dare mock me?*" the man shouted, screaming at his creator. What kind of God did this? Would allow this? "Three years ago to this day I found her, Zeus! No doubt her child - *your child* - would have been a healthy toddler; had she given birth!" The ensuing silence felt heavy, oppressive. Then laughter started, and grew, until the entire valley shook in it, revelled in it. Clouds parted, and Zeus himself came down to face him, his face twisted in laughter, his body muscle and sinew. "**How could she even be pregnant,**" the voice replied, laughing in great heaves, "**if I was not even in human form?**" His words hit him. He launched towards him, his fist clenched, his entire body poised. His fist caught Zeus on the chin, pushing him over the edge, sending him careening down the mountain. The man stood there alone, breathing heavily. Had this truly happened? Had he punched a God? He felt himself being watched. He looked up, and various gods of the pantheon looked down at him, with varying expressions. Ares came down and patted him on the back, almost slamming him to the floor. "Good job, man!" Ares cried with vigour, as he looked towards the other gods. "Did you guys see that? He fucking *nailed* him!" "Like Zeus did his wife," Dionysus joked under his breath. He gazed up at the gods. They were all so... *human*. So like him. Awe was replaced with disappointment, reverence with ridiculousness. It all felt so wrong, so pointless. He turned away, and began to walk down the mountain. Ares stopped him, with a mixture of curiosity and concern. A thunderstorm was brewing around them. "Are you sure you want to leave?" Ares asked, his hand on his shoulder. "When Zeus gets back he's going to *end you*." Already thunder could be heard in the distance. The man stared at him. "My wife is a whore, and the Gods are mad," he said, as he walked towards the lightning. "I'll make my own fate." **** The gods watched him go. Dionysus was the first to speak. "You know mortals cannot harm a god, right?" Dionysus said to Ares. Ares nodded. "I wonder if he knows," he said, as lightning crashed around them, and Dionysus smiled. "I guess they've got a pretty fucked up father-son relationship." **** ***** ***** If you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my new subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/) I'll try add new (and old) stories every day <3

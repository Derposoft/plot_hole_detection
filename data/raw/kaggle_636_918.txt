"I can honestly say that this is the first time I've ever attended a wish closing," said Az'galob the Deceiver. "Look, you want your soul, right? We're doing this the right way, then. By the way, are you *sure* you're not a demon?" This had been a point of some debate among myself and my attorney, Fred White. Fred was pretty sure that genies don't ask for souls or have names like Az'galob the Deceiver. We had agreed that it didn't matter in the end; a good contract would bind a demon just as well as a genie. Az'galob looked disgusted. "For the last time, that's racist," he said, with what, if I was any judge, sounded like a smattering of impatience to get on with the soul reaving. "Fine, fine," Fred broke in. It was time to start the closing. "If you will both turn to the first page." The introduction bit seemed to be your standard boilerplate. > This Contract is formed between Michael Lucas ("Lucas"), a human, and Az'galob the Deceiver ("ATD"), a demon, genie, and/or other non-human entity. (Collectively, the "Parties.") > > Definitions: > > 1: **Wish**: One request by Lucas for a desired outcome. No request shall count as a Wish unless Lucas precedes the request with the phrase, "Az'galob, I now wish for . . ." "Smart," Az'galob interjected, "you wouldn't believe how many people I've caught with the old 'You said "I wish"' trick." > 2: **Positive Outcome**: A scenario resultant from a Wish that is considered favorable by Lucas. > 3: **Negative Outcome**: A scenario resultant from a Wish that is considered disfavorable by Lucas. > 4: **Grant/Granted**: The state wherein a Wish made by Lucas has immediately come true due to intervention by ATD, and wherein ATD has striven to ensure that Lucas receives a Positive Outcome from his Wish, without knowingly causing a Negative Outcome. If Lucas's Wish has multiple reasonable interpretations or means of implementation that may result in Positive Outcomes without known Negative Outcomes, ATD shall attempt to discern Lucas's meaning through dialogue with Lucas. In the event of an emergency scenario wherein Lucas cannot engage in such discussion and/or is in imminent danger, ATD shall Grant the Wish by selecting any reasonable interpretation of the Wish that results in a Positive Outcome without knowingly causing a Negative Outcome. That last bit was important. You don't deal with an entity with the nickname "the Deceiver" without building in some protections. We had really gone back and forth on the language there. > WHEREAS the Parties intend to enter into an arrangement whereby they will exchange valuable consideration as discussed herein, the Parties agree to the following terms: > 5: **Consideration**: ATD shall Grant three (3) Wishes made by Lucas. In exchange, Lucas will tender any and all souls in his possession, custody, or control to ATD at the instant of Lucas's death. Upon reading this, I resisted the urge to again ask Az'galob if he was a demon. His part of the deal just seemed... demoney. "That looks like what we agreed on," said Az'galob. "You're not going to try to wish for more wishes or anything, are you? Everyone tries wishing for more wishes. I keep telling them that's not part of the deal." Fred responded to this. "If you look to Paragraph 8, you will find the "No infinite wishes" clause. Az'galob looked down, reading aloud: "Lucas shall not be allowed to make any Wish that has the effect of granting him additional Wishes." He blinked. Or at least, he approximated blinking as best he could without actually possessing eyelids. "That looks... fine? I'm just surprised you wrote yourself out of it. What about..." Fred cut him off. "You'll be looking for additional protections, I'm sure. Read the following paragraphs. There, you will find the 'No infinite genies' clause, the 'No wishing ATD would forget the contract or number of wishes' clause, the 'No wishing for the ability to self-grant wishes' clause, the 'No "ability to destroy or otherwise render ATD unable to collect soul due to incapacity"' clause, the 'No infinite life' clause, and--we've all seen *Aladdin*--the 'No wishing to become a genie' clause." Az'galob was astounded. For the first time in his life, he was looking at what appeared to be a "fair deal." This was something he had heard of, but never experienced himself. "Sign here and date here," Fred said. "No, there is no need to use the blood of the damned. Here's a pen. Are you *sure* you're not a demon?" Az'galob signed. I signed. The deal was done. It was all I could do to stop from laughing; I had a meeting scheduled for later today with a friendly cherub who Az'galob had once cheated at five-card stud. Turns out, someone named "Az'galob the Deceiver" can accumulate some enemies. The cherub would take possession, custody, and control of my soul at a point five minutes before my death, and would retain it until five minutes after my death. When I died, there would be no soul to collect. Fred passed me the first wish he had drafted for me. I already knew what it said, but I could not stop myself from smiling as I saw the words written down. I read it aloud. "Az'galob, I now wish for the word 'not' to be removed from Paragraph 8 of our contract." The roar of Az'galob the Recently-Deceived echoed across the Law Office of Fred White and Associates.

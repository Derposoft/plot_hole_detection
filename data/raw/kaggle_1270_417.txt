Blank. That's the best word I have to describe it. Let me explain. When I touch someone's neck, I can experience how they generally feel. And people are different. Some are flowery, almost petal-like. Others are smooth slabs of stone. Those having a rough time, they can be turbulent storms. I've been telling my friends that by touching their neck, I can help them figure out what they're feeling. So far, it's been great. Until today. You see, Xander has always been super cheerful. He's never seemed to have problems, and has an optimistic view. In fact, he usually makes the rest of us laugh. So when I touched his neck, I expected a carnival. A party. A festival. Not a void. There was just, nothing. It was like a blank canvas, except even a canvas is white. A canvas has a physical presence. This... Xander could see me recoil. "Hey, you okay?" "I, yeah. It's just -- there's nothing *there*." Xander's smile dropped. "I don't understand. I mean, I'm cheerful all the time, I make people laugh...can you look again? Maybe you got a bad connection or something." I sighed. It didn't really work like that. "Sure, I'll take another peek." This time was harder though. It's like a cold lake. If you don't know it's cold, you can plunge right in. But if you do know, you try to ease yourself into it bit by bit, which paradoxically makes it 10 times worse. Again, it was empty. Just, nothing. Wait. There was speck. In the center of it all, if that makes any sense. I, uh, "reached" out to it. If the emptiness was a cold lake, this was a red hot poker. And this feeling, I had to dust it off: >!~~I'm a girl~~!< I didn't understand. Was this the cause of it? At the same time, I could feel Xander getting restless. "Hey, is everything okay? Maybe I should go. A dude's gotta do stuff, ya know." What I did next was probably wrong. But I couldn't help it. I broke it open. And that void, that emptiness, *flooded* with pain and anguish. And Xander burst into tears. "What the fuck did you do?! No, I... I'm not this! I'm going." Xander bolted up, breaking the connection. "Wait! I can explain." "Fuck off," he spat. "Everything was okay. I had it under control! I was -- I was nice to be around. This, no one's going to accept this." And he stormed out.

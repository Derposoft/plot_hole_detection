The driver's license read 'John Ricardo'. "Who the fuck is John Ricardo?!" She exclaimed, her voice deep and hoarse. Where was her long flowing hair? Where were her high heels and designer bag? What the fuck was going on? The crowd around him, erm, her, was in the same chaotic and confused state. An older gentlemen was rolling around on the floor wailing like an infant, she was pretty sure he'd shit himself. A young boy was running about hysterically, screaming "I'm young again! It's a God damn miracle!"; and a beautiful woman had removed her clothes and couldn't seem to stop touching herself, her smile as wide as her eyes. The woman who now inhabited John Ricardo's bulky body lumbered over to an elderly woman who was sitting calmly on a bench, "Excuse me, but are you in your own body? Do you know what's going on?" The old woman frowned as she looked up, "No, I'm not in my own damn body. Just some other old bag who's just as wrinkled and broken as I am," She had slowly risen and began walking away, "Real good one, God, world-wide body swap and I'm still wearing a fuckin diaper, next time swap me with a corpse!" John Ricardo's body's new pilot saw a scuffle break out across the street, 'Oh no, people are losing it' She thought to herself 'Somebody needs to get this under control'. Her prayers were answered, someone was standing atop a police car and had a megaphone in hand, "Everyone! Please, calm down!" The scuffle had calmed, and all confused eyes now turned towards the sound of the commanding, yet delicate voice. "I know this may sound hard to believe, but I am a Brigadier General in the United States Army. Whatever has happened to us, we must work together to calmly reorganize and find a solution!" The crowd examined the vessel that emitted the sensible commands: A small girl, no more than 10 years of age, dressed in a girl scout's uniform. All were quiet for a few moments, until the silence was broken by the young boy who had been sprinting about in euphoria, "Yes, General, you're absolutely right. I'll have two boxes of thin mints and a box of Do-si-dos, Sir!" The crowd erupted into a roar of unfamiliar laughter ; John Ricardo's deep gut chuckle the loudest among them.

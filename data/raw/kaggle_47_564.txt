FADE IN: INT. AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT *Three men and a woman sit at a makeshift table, each of them facing what appears to be a haphazardly assembled stage. These are ALAN, STEVE, DAVE, and CHELSEA, respectively. Bare bulbs cast harsh illumination on the threadbare curtain, leaving the rest of the room in shadows.* **ALAN:** Okay, come on out. *The curtain is hesitantly pulled aside by a young man. This is ROBERT, a would-be terrorist.* **DAVE:** Introduce yourself, please. **ROBERT:** Uh... my name is, uh... Robert. **CHELSEA:** You're not really coming across as intimidating, Robert. *Robert ignores Chelsea, seemingly pretending that she isn't even present.* **STEVE:** I'll tell you right now, I just don't get a real commitment vibe from you. **ROBERT:** (*Shouting*) I am committed! I am dedicated to the cause! *Alan, Steve, Dave, and Chelsea all applaud.* **ALAN:** Much better! *Much* better! Now, Robert... what are you going to do for us today? **ROBERT:** ... What? **ALAN:** You don't think we let just *anyone* become a terrorist who wants to be one, do you? **STEVE:** That would be silly. **ALAN:** Right! So, what special talents can you bring to the table? **ROBERT:** I have a burning hatred for our oppressors. I have singleminded conviction. **CHELSEA:** That's really not enough, honey. That's like a singer saying "it's my dream." *Chelsea leans forward.* **CHELSEA:** (*CONT'D*) Is it your dream to die for the cause? *Robert ignores Chelsea again.* **DAVE:** Are you going to answer her? **ROBERT:** Why is there a... *female*... here? Females are *inferior!* *Alan, Dave, and Steve react with shock and mild disgust.* **ALAN:** *Whoa!* Not okay, Robert! **STEVE:** Save that hatred for the cause, buddy. **DAVE:** No, wait, not for the cause. *Alan and Steve turn to look at Dave.* **STEVE:** What? **DAVE:** You're not supposed to hate the cause. You're supposed to *love* the cause. **STEVE:** You know what I meant. **DAVE:** Of course I do! Robert is new to the terrorism game, though. We don't want to confuse him. **ROBERT:** (*Shouting*) What the hell is going on?! *All eyes turn back to Robert.* **ROBERT:** (*CONT'D*) You're supposed to be a cell of ruthless killers! You're supposed to be dedicated to restoring morals and values! *Dave snorts.* **DAVE:** (*Muttering*) Morals and values through killing people... *He glances around at the other members of his group.* **DAVE:** (*CONT'D*) I mean, uh... heil hatred. **ALAN, STEVE, and CHELSEA:** Heil hatred! **ROBERT:** (*Screaming*) Stop, stop, *stop!* Is this a test?! Are you trying my sanity? **CHELSEA:** What's the problem? **ROBERT:** This isn't a recruitment! This is a goddamned "American Idol" audition! **ALAN:** No, it isn't. This is how terrorists recruit. **STEVE:** Totally. I've recruited, just... *so many* terrorists. **DAVE:** Me, too! *Robert stares at the group, mouth agape. After a moment, he sighs and speaks into the collar of his shirt.* **ROBERT:** Stand down, everyone. These are just a bunch of buffoons. *From all around the darkened warehouse, figures in combat gear walk into the light. Dave, Steve, Alan, and Chelsea gawk at the sudden appearance. Robert pulls out a badge.* **ROBERT:** (*CONT'D*) DHS. You're all under arrest. **DAVE:** Hey, wait! I'm FBI! *Dave pulls out a badge.* **STEVE:** Uh... CIA. *Steve also pulls out a badge.* **ALAN:** NSA. *ALAN pulls out his own badge. All eyes to turn Chelsea, who pulls out a detonator.* **CHELSEA:** (*Shouting*) Heil hatred! CUT TO BLACK.

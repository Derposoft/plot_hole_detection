######[](#dropcap) Robbie is paging through one of the PDFs on his desktop. He chuckles, then turns his monitor to me. "Hey, check this out - there's no fee for filing, unless you *want* to pay it." "Jesus Christ. I can't believe we didn't think of this sooner. When I think of all the time I've been paying taxes like a God-damn chump." "Right? And actually...if I'm reading this right, we don't have to even send out the paperwork. We just have to have records of the name of the church and that we occasionally hold services." "So...Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Gridiron?" "Nah. I mean, sure, but if we're gonna do this, we should do it right. Get a cool name." Robbie and I are silent for a while. Then it hits me. "The Cult of...Mzarix, the Unholy Badger." He smirks, then shakes his head. "What about The *Dark* Cult of Mzarix, the Unholy Badger?" "Better!" I nod, and Robbie starts typing. "First rule: Robbie and Doug are high priests, and there shall be no others above us in His beady, ebon eyes..." *** I don't remember much after that. I drove home from Robbie's, figuring I would order that poster of a unicorn having sex with a dolphin I always wanted. And then... I open my eyes. I am on a table. It is bright. "*He awakes! We are successful!*" There is loud cheering. I blink, then sit up. I am in a black room. No, check that, it's a cave. Why the hell am I in a cave? And what I thought was a table is actually an altar that appears to be made of...obsidian? I peer over the edge. There is a pentagram circumscribed around the altar. A young man lies on the ground nearby, his skin sheet-white save for the deep crimson liquid staining his arms. "*All grovel before The Exalted Doug!*" There are murmurs and whispers. As one, the robed circle falls to the floor of the cave. I stand up. "Um...hello." One of the figures raises his head, and speaks to me from the depths of his hood. "Praise Mzarix, His Claws Mighty, you have been returned to the Burrow of Reality!" I nod slowly. "Yes...I sure have. Uh...what...?" The apparent leader of the group continues speaking: "Your Most Esteemed Dougness, a thousand pardons, but we have not yet finished collecting the dozen 'bootylicious virgins of character most lewd,' as set down in The Badger-ation Proclamation." I frown. "That's...okay. Say, do you --" "And also The Cask of Eternal Beer is still being constructed, but we expect it to be completed soon." "Right. The Cask..." Some of these phrases are sounding familiar, but I am having trouble placing them. My head is throbbing, and as I reach up to touch it, I discover something odd. "Is...is there a chance my hand is on backwards?" The leader bows his head, his voice full of sorrow. "May His musk glands secrete His terrible fragrance on me, we lowly supplicants did the best we could to re-assemble your body, but there were some...hiccups." I take a breath. There is a buzzing sound that may actually be coming from inside my head. Suddenly the cave feels claustrophobic, and my breathing is shallow. "Oh...kay. Can I, uh, step outside for a moment?" The figure leaps to his feet. "Aside, grubs, make way for His Eminent Awesomeness, The Arch-Doug of Schenectady, Doug!" At the mouth of the cave I squint into the dazzling brilliance. "So...you are all followers...of..." The leader nods "Mzarix, the Unholy Badger, His Snout Be Eternal, yes." "Good. That's...so good. I'm...very happy right now." "I'm so pleased, as I'm sure is Mzarix. When would you like to meet Him?" I turn to look at the robed figure, his features still hidden in the dark cloth. "I...what?" "The Claw That Sunders the Light, The Snuffling Darkness, Father of the Accursed Cete." "He...uh...sorry, what?" "I understand, Most Doug of Dougs, how disorienting this must be for all of you. But Mzarix is eager to meet one of His most devoted followers at last." "Oh...kay. So, like, this is a statue, and His spirit resides in it, or something?" The figure's head cocks to one side, and as his garment shifts, I can make out what is unmistakably a dark snout protruding from beneath his hood. "Statue?" *Sweet Jesus*, I think. *What have I gotten myself into?* *** *Check out my sub /r/ShadowsofClouds for plenty of other stories ranging from silly to dark.* *Edit to add: [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowsofClouds/comments/97vew8/doug_the_exalted_one_part_2/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowsofClouds/comments/97x6k1/doug_the_exalted_one_part_3/), and [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowsofClouds/comments/97zyd9/doug_the_exalted_one_part_4/) are now up.* *Edit 2: For those of you wondering, they made the obsidian altar with BADGER MAGIC...or, as I like to call it,* **BADGIC.** *But it's good that you asked, because that's definitely the only part of the story that's implausible. :)*

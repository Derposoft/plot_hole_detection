When I was a teenager my mother asked me what I thought love was. Having just ended what I believed was my first real relationship. Completely distraught, dazed by the haze of infatuation I told her it was about feeling whole. About finding that one person who complements your faults. Who lifts you up and makes you feel like a better person. I was completely unaware that love was two sided. Could only see it for how it affected my own well-being. Or presumptive well-being. She asked me again nearly a decade later, after telling her I was planning on asking my then girlfriend to marry me. And I told her it wasn't about finding someone to complement your faults, but finding someone who was wholly compatible with the basic structures of my personality. That we could have major disagreements, but that so long as we agreed on the tenets of our own personal progress, and agreed to work together in tandem, we could overcome anything. That relationship fell apart a few months before the wedding. We realized that compatibility doesn't imply love. That we respected each other, and liked each other, but weren't in love. And like so many people I began to question whether love was actually tangible. Like other ephemeral ideas, maybe it was something that could be such a common trope but something nearly impossible to experience. The mere limitations of language pushing a narrative of something that was so deeply personal, it couldn't be adequately defined. I first met Anne about six months ago. We had had a series of arguments about how to pinpoint an anniversary. The kind of relationship that just kind of happens, and before you know it you're staring into the eyes of someone and it just feels right. Or so you think. From the moment I met her, I knew we were doomed. But it felt good so I went along with it anyways. Anne was a highly acclaimed theater actor, and refused to ever talk about it. Pretended like her celebrity status didn't exist. So, I buried it down, pretended like I never knew. Would occasionally hint at it, but she would immediately retreat. And that's when it fully dawned on me. Love is vulnerability. Love isn't some grand gesture, it isn't some heartfelt feeling, or shared experience. It's the ability to truly be vulnerable with someone. To escape millions of years of evolution. To allow someone else to define their experience of your being. That we spend so much time manicuring this image of ourselves and how we portray it to other people. Love is dropping all pretenses about how you think someone will judge you. She first told me she loved me about a month after we met. And I reciprocated. My mind turning through something that seems so easy for other people to understand. She probably noticed my insincerity. About a month ago she finally invited me to a work event, which turned out to be the opening night of her new play. Surprised me as we stepped out of the limo to the cheering crowds of people. I acted surprised, and she seemed to play long. For the first time, she smiled at me with complete sincerity. And it felt good. We broke up a few days later. My mother asked me what had happened and I explained that I just didn't love her. That if it took her six months to finally admit something so basic, that our future would just be battle after battle. Trying to crack through the surface. For the first time, I asked her what *she* thought love was. Because obviously, I was doing it wrong. She told me that she didn't actually care about love. That at the end of the day if you needed to use it as a crutch to justify a relationship it was probably doomed anyways. And I realized that I have no clue what love is. But that maybe that was okay. ________________________________________ /r/squidcritic

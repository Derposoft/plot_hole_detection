"Stop villain!" I thrust my hand outward, my shout twice as loud as any normal man's. The thief glared at me, his squinty eyes all a squintin' at yours truly. He seemed moderately startled by my intrusion, which is the very best kind of startled since it was exactly twice as startled as mildly startled. He gave me a sneer, one hand clutching the bag of money to his chest, "What's it to you? You some kinda hero or sumthin'?" I laughed a great, heaving laugh, flashing teeth twice as pearly as the average amount of pearliness. Indeed, they were positively phosphorescent. Luminous even. The villain could not help but squint even squintier before my patented PEARLGLEAM(tm) of justice. "Your underhanded days are done." I yanked off my pants, revealing a stunningly tailed spandex onesie, an M perfectly embroidered onto each perfectly sculpted buttock. I placed my hands on my hips, the spandex gripping my thighs struggling to contain my bulgeous double bulge. The villain caught it at a glance and looked visibly disconcerted. I used his distraction at my main attraction to leap into action. I took the strides with my patented DOUBLESPEED(tm), closing the gap between us. His eyes widened as I approached, his hand moving at normal speed behind his back. My legs pumped furiously, my PEARLGLEAM(tm) shining brightly into his face. Ten steps away. His hand emerged from behind his back, gripping a gun. Nine. He frantically tried to bring the gun to bear, futilely attempting to outrace the Double Quick Double Man known the city over as MANMAN(tm)(tm). Eight. The poor fool, did he not know there was no hope for an ordinary man before my (tm)DUECEMIGHT(tm)? It would take no less than...two men to meet my equal and he was but one. Seven. The gun was making surprising progress at being aimed in my general direction. Six. I don't much care for guns. They pack the punch of a dozen dozen men, which was, alas, substantially more than my DUO(tm)STRENGTH(tm). But I was committed. The city was at stake. Or at least however much cash was inside that Subway he had just robbed. Five. Probably at least $40. They don't keep a lot of cash on hand normally. Three. The gun was now aimed squarely at me, the nefarious Subway Thief(r) cackling wildly as his finger began to compress the trigger. Two. This was going to be a problem. BAM. **Platypus OUT.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

"Nice and easy does it." "Captain, you're the one flying this thing," Shayna muttered. "You know you don't need to talk to yourself while you do it, right," "It helps with my focus, Shayna. Now shush. We don't have long before the Gammids know we're in their space." Shayna nodded firmly, her blue hair cascading as she did. Gammids were nasty customers and would not respond well to a Tyri ship in their space. "Lock achieved," she said. Hayden let out a whoop of excitement. "Let's power up the engines and get out of here! That's three hundred kilograms of pure Uranium wrapped up in another seven hundreds of useless rocks - we're going to be rich!" "You said that we were going to be rich after the last job, Captain," Shayna muttered to herself. "Well, we had to repair the 'did after that one. Ain't going to happen again, Shayna." Shayna tapped the console. "Tell that to the Gammids." Hayden whipped his head to the console. Three Gammid cruisers on approach, sending hailing signals. "Tyri ship! You have encroached on Gammid Space. Prepare to be boarded." Hayden groaned, and Shayna looked up at him. "She we run?" "Punch it," Hayden confirmed. The Gammid and Tyri descended from the same base species - a race called humanity - but bioengineering done before the collapse of the last Empire meant they were vastly genetically different. So different, in fact, the Gammids had no qualms about eating Tyri who violated their territory. They turned the engines to full and began a hard burn. Once their orbit would take them away from the Gammid's main star, it would just be a matter of letting the point defense system take care of any missiles the Gammids sent their way until they could get to safe wormhole distance and doing minor trajectory adjustments to escape any kinetic or beam projectiles. Simple. Safe. The twenty missiles the Gammids sent their way, clustered too tightly for a ship as small as the Katydid's Point Defense protocol? Nothing to worry about. Hayden was sweating as he poured more power into the burn. "Captain, we're going to be hit!" Shayna shouted, before broadcasting to the rest of the ship. "All crew; we are doing a hard burn, hard burn! Strap yourselves in." Hayden could only hope everyone did as he doubled the thrust, feeling the acceleration press him back into the chair. "Make the jump!" Hayden shouted. "Shayna, make the damn jump!" "We're too close to the gravity well!" She shouted back. "Those missiles are too close to us!" he countered. "Damnit, damnit, damnit," Shayna swore, but input the commands. Around the engine, Hayden knew, a wormhole was beating created with exotic matter, one that rapidly expanded to engulf the entire ship. He felt a stretching sensation, and then they were gone. --- ________________________________________ They weren't in the wormhole for more than ten seconds, emerging back in Tyri space. "Captain, we almost got killed!" "I noticed," Hayden said, rubbed his temple. Going through the wormhole always gave him a headache. "Where are we?" "Just inside the border. Didn't want to risk a long jump. Captain..." The console started beeping. Shayna scowled at him and pushed a button. "To whoever is left to hear this," the voice said, and Hayden frowned. "That's English," "Quiet," Shayna said, although she was frowning too. No one had spoken English in nearly two thousand years. Ships computers could still translate it, as well as most of the languages of old Humanity, but no one used it. The exchanged had caused them to miss part of the message. "Casting to inform you that Earth is now inhabitable again. Repeat, Earth is now inhabitable again. Sensors are detecting temperatures had returned back into habitable ranges. You can come home." Hayden slumped back in his chair. "Shayna, did that message come with coordinates?" Shayna nodded her eyes wide. "A G-Class star near the edge of the galaxy. Captain..." Hayden nodded. Earth. The mythical homeland of humanity. If it was back in play..."It'll be the biggest gold rush ever known." Every Human descended species in the galaxy was going to be rushing there. "Shayna, are the engines still hot for warp?" She nodded. "Do we have enough for the jump?" "Barely, captain. It'll take a couple weeks before we've generated enough exotic matter to create more - and we'll pretty much burn up the uranium we just grabbed doing so." "Don't care. Punch it. We're going to be the first people to get there." For once, Shayna didn't argue. She started to fire up the warp engines. "It'll be a couple days in transit, Captain. You should inform the crew." Hayden nodded, rising to do so. If Earth was back in play, if they could stake a claim before the various governments sorted things out - it would mean an end to this, an end to the endless scrabbling for a life. And it would hopefully mean they would be safe from the Galactic War that would follow. --- more at /r/Hydrael_Writes EDIT: Fixed some formatting and typos.

I carefully pried off the boards on the delapidated Starbucks. I know what you're thinking, *"Who the hell loots a Starbucks after the apocalypse?"* Well, sometime, you just need a cuppa, and all the grocery stores have run out. I slipped in between the boards. The one upside of the scarcity of a post-people society is that you drop extra pounds pretty quick once the hunger and terror-running set in. I'm in the store, with my electric lantern to light the place. It's a rathole, like everywhere else, but the pretentious attitude of the place still seemed to hang in the air, years after any humans abandoned it, as if to say "I was a filthy shithole *before* is went mainstream." I made my way to the counter and hopped over. I rooted around underneath the counter to see if I could find any keys. Maybe if I could get into the store room, I could even get enough to trade for stuff. After having no luck finding the key to the back, I stood up and turned around to come face-to-face with one of them. We called them zombies at first, but then it became quite apparent that these things maintained at least part of their intelligence and personality after changing. Some people still call them zombies, but I prefer the term "revenant." I feel it's more accurate. So there, not a foot in front of my face, was a revenant, and he didn't look to pleased with me. *"Shit, this is it,"* I said to myself. I'd developed a bad habit of talking to myself. "What the Hell are you talking about?" The revenant said. "I, uh, what?" This was a weird situation for me. "What were you talking about?" "I, uh, I thought you were going to eat my still-living flesh while I screamed in agony." The revenant looked at me like *I* was the weird, gross monster. He paused for a moment to step back and size me up. "...The fuck are you talking about?" "You're a revenant, right? You're not feeling any cannibalistic urges?" "Well, unlike other people, I can control myself. I'm a vegan, after all." I rolled my eyes before I could stop myself, an old reflex from civilization. "What, you're not?" "Uh, no. I still eat meat. Just not human meat." "Psh. Just because you don't eat human meat, doesn't mean you're any better than them. You still buy into the abusive neo-capitalist system that encourages the abuse of animals for profit under the guise of 'nutrition.'" "Okay, okay, am I being punk'd here? Because this is just getting surreal." I looked around to see if I could spot any cameras that weren't ripped out of the wall. The revenant sighed. "Okay, I can see you're confused, let me take the high road and start over. My name's Roger, and I'm a vegan zombie." I sighed in return, and tried to gather myself. "Alright, that I've gathered. But how do you survive? I thought revenants had to eat meat, and had a particular preference for human meat?" "Nah, that's just what they want you to think. We can live just fine on plant-based protein, and that cannibaliztic drive comes from toxins in the meat you eat. If you switch to a fully vegan diet, you'll see that you'll never want meat of any kind again." "...Right. Okay, I have a laundry list of questions, but I think the first is what you've been living on?" "Oh yeah, man. I've been eating mostly beans, nuts, and rice. I used to have these really nice spices, but I ran out." "And you're telling me you have no urge to consume my warm, pink flesh?" "Nope, not even a little." A bit of saliva was visible at the corner of his mouth, which he quickly wiped away. I frowned at him. "Okay, maybe a little bit, fine, but I'm still trying to detox, okay? And I have it under control." "Alright, well, this has been very...educational. But I'm just gonna get out of your hair." I turned to leave and maybe see if I could find any antipsychotics in a pharmacy in town. "Wait, man. You came here for coffee, right?" "...Yeah?" "If you can bring me some spices, you can have all the coffee you want. Beans and rice gets a little bland after a while." "Uh...sure, why not? A fetch quest for a vegan zombie, how much weirder could this day get?" "Alright, catch you later. And if you need to get in, just knock on the back door." I mentally kicked myself for not checking the back door in the first place, nodded and left. I still didn't trust the guy, but by God, I was going to have my coffee. **EDIT:** Hoh-*lee* **shit**. I did not expect the kind of response this has gotten. I've been pretty busy lately, but if I can find the time, I'll try to do more. Like wow, guys, you're making me blush.

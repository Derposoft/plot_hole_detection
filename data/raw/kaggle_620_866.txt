"I wish they'd just agree on something and shut up." I thought. Sighted people take silence for granted. Quiet. Or listening to a book. It's really the only time I get any peace. Every fart, every word, every gust of fucking wind is the equivalent of nails on a goddamned chalkboard to people who can't see. I raised the volume on my MP3 player and tried to ignore them. No such luck. "Enough of this shit." I muttered and stabbed my feet into what, based on their stench, I could only assume were the rattiest slippers on the face of the earth and made my way downstairs. "What's going on dad?" I asked. "Nothing's going on. Do me a favor & go get me a beer." he said. I heard him but it didn't register. I stood there like an idiot staring. I was staring. I never got the chance to stare but here I was. Staring. I was staring at my dad. "Mike? Beer?" in that offhanded, mildly annoyed tone he used when someone didn't jump at his say so. "Yeah. I mean, yes sir. Got it." I blurted. I've lived here my whole life. I know every inch. Couldn't tell you the color of the walls but from where I'm standing it's exactly 64 steps to the upstairs toilet & 26 steps from the toilet to my bedroom door. It's 44 steps to the fridge. A short 44 steps later I'm there with a cold can of beer in each hand. 44 steps back. "Here you go. I got one for your friend, too." I said. "Thank you, Mike. Now go listen to a book or something. Dad's busy right now." and he resumed talking - arguing? - with his new buddy. On my way upstairs I stopped dead in my tracks. What I'd always thought was a picture was actually a mirror. There I was. That's me. That's what I look like. Oh, fuck. "Mike, I told you to get upstairs." dad commanded. It was more of a growl than a request. "Sorry dad. I'm, uh, a little dizzy." I snapped out of it and made my way upstairs. I know enough to know when things aren't right. I'm blind, not stupid. 32 steps later & I'm knocking on my parent's bedroom door. "Ma? Mom? You in there?" I called. "Yeah. Come in." she replied. "Remember when nana died?" I asked. Her face lost all animation. Her face. I could see her face. My mom's face. Holy shit. "Yes. Why are you asking about nana, Mikey?" she asked. "Did I do anything ... funny when she died?" I asked. "Not that I recall." she said. What could she recall? She was a disaster that whole week. Losing her mom took a lot out of her. At this moment, I could understand why. "Like, did I say anything or do anything weird that day?" I continued. "Mikey, I really don't want to talk about this now. Your father is talking to the man who rear ended him last week. Can you believe the nerve on this guy? He rear ends your dad & offers to pay the damages if we didn't file a report but now he doesn't want to pay the full cost. Dad's just going to call the cops, I think. That guy gave me the creeps the second I saw him. Probably why daddy agreed to handle it out of court." I almost heard what she said. I was too busy studying her face. "Okay." I said. "Hey Mom? Could you do me a favor?" "What is it, hun? Hey, you look funny. Is something wrong?" she replied, reaching out and touching my cheek with the back of her hand. I didn't recoil. I didn't move at all. "No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just hungry. Can you make me a Hot Pocket?" I asked. "No, dinner will be ready in an hour. You can wait." she answered. "Please ma? I'm really hungry. A Hot Pocket won't make any difference." I pleaded. "Fine." She said. "But you'd better eat dinner. You know how your father gets." She's my mom. She knows that when I've made up my mind to do something, there's just no talking to me. I get that from her. Rather than arguing a futile point about how hungry I was, she just agreed. She also knows my father. If someone says they'll do something and they don't, he can be a real dick. That's gotten him in trouble before. I watched mom stand up and walk out of the room. Watched her. Maybe she didn't remember about nana but I did. Voices downstairs now sounded angrier than they should have. I made my way the 14 steps to dad's night table and opened the drawer. Cold, hard & too heavy for its size. Yup. That's dad's pistol. I tucked it into my jeans and counted the 89 steps down the hall, down the stairs and to the foyer. When I reached the last step, I couldn't see dad anymore but as I curled my fingers around the revolver I could suddenly see his new friend.

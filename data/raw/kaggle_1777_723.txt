An unexpected change, as the last thing he remembered, was lying down in a hospital bed. A bed he had been certain he would never leave again. Upon closer inspection, he stood on a white, somewhat fluffy, material. Even though he had no idea what it felt like to stand and walk on a cloud he thought this would be a very good approximation. He looked back up and noticed the glowing golden gate in front of him for the first time. It was a very peculiar gate. Its sides weren't attached to anything, it just separated the space he was standing on from the space behind the gate. If Pete wanted to, he could just walk around it. The gate opened, it's two sides sliding inward. "EnTER AnD YE HALL BE JUDgED!" a voice boomed all around him. It slowly dawned on Pete. "So the Catholics were right?" He thought back to the bible studies his parents had made him go to in his youth. He was in a world of trouble. Turning around, Pete looked for a way out. There wasn't any. It was a vast expanse of white fluffy cloud as far as he could see. The only thing breaking the monotony was the gate and Pete himself. "HURRY UP, I DOn'T HAVE ALL DAY." *What?* Pete shrugged, stepping forward. *Eternal damnation it is.* As he cleared the gate Pete saw something on the horizon. Having no better idea of where to go, Pete headed towards it. After what felt like an eternity to Pete he got close enough to make out some details. It looked like the back side of a throne. "God?" Pete asked hesitantly. The throne started to spin. The entity on the throne and Pete couldn't define it any better than 'entity', looked like something out of a horror movie. Roughly human shaped it had wings on it's back, tentacles as beard and scales. "YEAH, ABOUT THAT," the entity on the throne said seeing the shock written in Pete's face, "I REALLY HAVE nO IDEA WHERE YOU HUMAn gET ALL YOUR IDEA ROM." It shrugged and put what looked like an oversized iPhone phone down. "THOUgH OME ARE REALLY nEAT", it said pointing to the mobile now placed on the armrest of the throne. "AnY oUETIOn BEORE WE BEgIn JUDgEMEnT?" "Yes, millions. What is this? Were the Catholics right? Who are you? Am I going to hell? What is the meaning of li..." the entity raised its claw-hand and Pete stopped. "THI I YOUR JUDgEMEnT. ALL RELIgIOn ARE RIgHT AnD WROng AT THE AME TIME. THE OnLY OnE WHO WROTE DOWn PART O THE RULE CORRECTLY WA A BLOKE CALLED LEVITICU, AnD EVEn HE gOT MOT O IT WROng. A OR WHO I AM," the entity grabbed something from behind the throne, "I WA TIRED O AnWERIng THAT oUETIOn EACH AnD EVERY TIME, O I HAD OnE O YOU WRITE A oUICK UMMARY," he handed a stack of badly copied and stapled pages to Pete. The cover showing a stylized resemblance of the entity with the title "The Call of Cthulhu" written below it. "SO, LET' EE HOW YOU DID," Cthulhu picked up the mobile, "IT' ALL In HERE. nEAT, RIgHT?" While Pete was wondering if that was a rhetoric question or if he was supposed to answer, Cthulhu had already started listing aspects of Pete's life. "ALWAY TRIED TO BE nICE ... gOOD, gAVE MOnEY TO CHARITY ... gOOD, CHOE CAT OVER DOg ... BAD, TRIED TO LEAD An EnVIROnMEnTALLY RIEnDLY LIE ... gOOD," the list went on an on. Pete tuned out, not fully understanding the way this worked. Would he sum up all 'good' and 'bad' items in the end and decide? "GAY" Pete cringed, he had been afraid of this one "NO OnE CARE," Cthulhu went on to the next items. "MIxED LInEn AnD WOOL" Cthulhu groaned. "WHY? WHY DO YOU HUMAn ALWAY DO THI. THI I LIKE THE OnLY RULE THAT MATTER. WELL, MURDER TOO, BUT MIxIng ABRIC?" Cthulhu put the phone away "SORRY, BUT THI REALLY I YOUR OWn AULT." He raised his arm, summoning a door, fire dancing around its edges. Pete heard screams as the door opened. ****** r/John_writes

When I was 10 I watched an hour and a half of caveman porn thinking it was 10,000 BC by t2_7828d59t

When I was a kid (2010) my dad collected DVDs and in turn it made me into a huge movie buff. Because I lived with my mom I didnâ€™t have access to this collection but I wanted to watch movies like him. I quickly became unreasonably good at finding movie files online I could download to my desktop on my laptop. Somewhere in my search I ended up accidentally downloading this browser type thingâ€”I completely forget the nameâ€”when clicked it would open a small grey window that felt a bit Windowâ€™s 97 esque but grey, and it had a search bar. Absolutely any movie I searched in was available for immediate download at varying (but mostly high) quality. It was a blessing and never let me down. I watched TONS of movies this way and Iâ€™d probably still use it today if that laptop wasnâ€™t long broken

One of the movies he loved was 10,000 BC, so match that with the awesome case cover in his collection, it was on my list. I searched it, downloaded it, and sat down to watch it. It was 3 guys going around doing, stuff, I honestly canâ€™t remember much. There was a cannibal tribe I know this. Why canâ€™t I remember anything about the plot? *Because there was so much cave sex. So. Much. Cave. Sex.* I never saw a dick enter a pussy but I saw plenty of nice shots of them separately, and PLENTY of animalistic cave-man humping. There was one scene with this really thick woman bending over at a creek and some dude just comes up and started fucking her doggy-style! I sat there and watched and hour and a half of cave-man porn, and as the credits rolled I couldnâ€™t stop thinking about how that was NOT what I expected and WHY did my dad like that movie so much?

Anyways I spent years just accepting the fact that 10,000 BC was a horrible movie, and somewhere along the road realized I didnâ€™t actually watch 10,000 BC. So then where did this caveman porn come from? Turns out there must have been some titling mixup on that program because I watched the weird 80â€™s cave-fantasy movie â€˜Quest For Fireâ€™ which honestly should be R rated if itâ€™s not already ðŸ˜­ I gotta watch it again for nostalgia

TL;DR: Wanted to be like my dad so I spent an evening watching cave people have sex. It wasnâ€™t actually even cave-porn, it was the weird 80â€™s movie Quest For Fire

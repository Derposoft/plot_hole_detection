It started with little things, I guess. Taunts, 'innocent' questions, jibes, pitying glances, derogatory comments. Nothing violent. Nothing terribly awful. A little crude though, sometimes. And always insulting. &#x200B; Now it's not as though I'm *not* weak, or slow, or dull, or *whatever* they want to call me t'day, but it's the fact that they're calling me all this--saying whatever they want straight to my face--without even knowing me that really gets me. &#x200B; I mean, *come on*! Give me a chance to show you how weak and slow and dull I am before you just pin the labels on there and expect me to be okay with it! That's all I'm asking. But no, sir. Because everyone's gotta be a racist. &#x200B; So as you can imagine, these comments got real old, real quick. But the first time I got shoved down the stairs, well. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. And my arm. &#x200B; I couldn't just take that sorta treatment sitting down, y'see. &#x200B; Now, I am by *no means* a violent person. In fact, I'm a pacifist, for all that I'm one of the top shooters in the school. It's kinda hard not to be a pacifist in this day and age, unless you're going out onto the front lines. And if I was, I would've done that instead of coming here. &#x200B; But that doesn't mean I was fine with just sitting back and letting these assholes say whatever the hell they want 'bout me simply because I'm a human! That's stupid. There's no reason the other students should've been allowed to act as they did, and there's no reason I shouldn't be allowed to retaliate when they send me home for the weekend with two spiral fractures and a cast as thick as their skulls. &#x200B; They got what was coming to 'em, sir. &#x200B; That doesn't mean I meant to do as much damage as I did, though. It was meant to be a simple prank. Honest. I never meant to send no-one to the hospital. &#x200B; And maybe I would've done something else if I'd have known what the consequences would've been. Or if *someone* in this entire school had treated me with some fuckin' respect. But no. Not one person--student, teacher, or even the *janitor*--treated me like anything but someone to be pitied and picked on. Not. One. &#x200B; That's why I swapped the *Second Sol Smoothie* for my own creation. I just wanted to make somethin' that would taste a little awful--maybe give 'em all a bit of a stomach ache. How was I supposed to know cherries, garlic an' grapes are toxic to everyone who's not a human? What--because my dog ate some last year and got sick? Of course not! No one teaches us this shit. &#x200B; Everyone's always goin' on 'bout how weak we are compared to the other species, sir. Guess it's just my luck that we're the only ones who have a strong stomach.

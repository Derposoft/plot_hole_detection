I'd died already. I look around. I'm in a small rundown apartment. It smells. It's too small. It's too big. It's...empty. There is cracking plaster where my legendary swords are supposed to be. A small TV where my Mythic Artifacts are supposed to be displayed. An empty chair where Maria should be. I think I'd always known in some part of my mind that none of it was real. That I was hooked up to a VR device in another world. I'd tried to forget, I'd tried so hard. But in the end death comes to us all. I was a God in that world, a hero. Someone Maria would be happy to be with, but here... I look around. I'm a loser with a video game addiction. I briefly entertain the notion of finding Maria in this real world, but I think better of it. What if she doesn't want me as I am? What if she hadn't even been real? An NPC? No I couldn't take that. I wouldn't take that. There was only one thing to do. Death comes to us all. *** I'd died already. I look around. I'm in a video game booth. There are people of all colors and clothing hooked up to the same kind of VR device I held in my hand all around me. No. I'd died. This....this couldn't be happening. I think back, try to remember. Was this me? Was this my real life? This had to be, it had to be. Death, after all, comes to us all. *** I'd died already. I look around, my heart still beating hard. I'm on a couch with a giant 50 inch screen in front of me and a VR device in my hand. A woman with golden locks sits next to me, immersed in her own VR device. Nononononono. Death comes to us all, it has to. It has to. *** I'd died already. An office with bare furnishings. Death comes to us all. *** I'd died already. A government testing facility. Death comes to us all. *** I'd died already. A cruise ship. Death comes to us all. *** I'd died already. What seemed like a wizard's tower. Death comes to us all. *** I'd died already. Death comes to us all. *** I'd died already. Death comes to us all. *** I'd died already. Death comes to us all. *** I'd never died before. Perhaps death didn't come to everyone after all. *** (minor edits) If you enjoyed, check out [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/)

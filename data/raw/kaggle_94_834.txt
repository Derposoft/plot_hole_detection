FADE IN: INT. HEAVEN - GOD'S OFFICE - DAY *The doors to an ornate office burst open, and a grandfatherly figure in a tweed suit pulls a young man in by his ear. These are GOD and DAVE, respectively. God has apparently been lecturing Dave for some time.* **GOD:** So, Dave, if you *really* think you can do better, show me! **DAVE:** Ow. *God releases Dave's ear. The young man stands up and looks around the room. It resembles an opulent study in an English mansion.* **DAVE:** This is Heaven? **GOD:** This is my office. **DAVE:** Why does it smell like pipe tobacco? **GOD:** What you perceive here is entirely your choice. **DAVE:** Why would I choose to perceive the smell of pipe tobacco? **GOD:** It's what you expected. Therefore, it is. **DAVE:** ... Okay, well, I can spot some flaws in that. *God's face adopts an expression of impatience.* **GOD:** Yes, that's why you're here. This is what your constant complaining has gotten you. *Dave rubs the ear that was being held.* **DAVE:** I think we've had a bit of a misunderstanding. **GOD:** Oh, have we? **DAVE:** When I said that a monkey could have designed a better universe... *Dave trails off.* **GOD:** Yes? **DAVE:** To be honest, I expected you to interrupt me. **GOD:** Why would I do that? **DAVE:** I kind of set you up for it. You could have said "I went and got a monkey!" **GOD:** And now that monkey thinks he's going to outwit his creator. Have at it, then. **DAVE:** I already gave you the punchline. *God gestures around the room.* **GOD:** I mean have at *this!* Try your hand at running the universe! **DAVE:** I don't... **GOD:** (*Interrupting*) No, no, please! I'm eager to see just how *easy* you'll make it seem! **DAVE:** You interrupted me. **GOD:** As you expected me to. *Dave considers this for a moment.* **DAVE:** Okay. FADE TO: ------ INT. HEAVEN - GOD'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY *The doors to God's office burst open once again, and God storms in. The expensive finery and furniture have been replaced with utilitarian (but still aesthetically pleasing) installments. Dave sits at an unadorned desk, looking at a sheet of silvery paper.* **GOD:** (*Angrily*) What did you do?! **DAVE:** Just a moment, please. This is somewhat time-sensitive. **GOD:** Time is wholly irrelevant here! Answer me: What did you do?! *Dave looks over the paper at God.* **DAVE:** I fixed it. **GOD:** Fixed what? **DAVE:** The universe. You had a number of inefficiencies that I've cleaned up. *God narrows his eyes at Dave.* **GOD:** And how, exactly, did you do that? **DAVE:** Applied theology. **GOD:** That is not a thing. **DAVE:** It is now. **GOD:** *How?!* **DAVE:** Applied theology. **GOD:** That's not an answer! **DAVE:** Yes, well, the Dave works in mysterious ways. *An angry croaking noise escapes God's throat. He struts up to Dave's desk and slams his hands onto it.* **GOD:** Start talking! **DAVE:** Aren't you supposed to be omniscient? **GOD:** I can and will smite you. *Dave sighs and puts the paper down. It appears to be covered with scribbles worthy of a three-year-old.* **DAVE:** Look, you told me that I would perceive what I expected to. **GOD:** Yes. **DAVE:** That struck me as odd... until I realized that it didn't just apply to your office. **GOD:** What do you mean? **DAVE:** Well, think about it: You're apparently the personification of a Christian deity, which means that my expectations were shaping your appearance and behavior just as much as they were shaping our environment. In essence, I was creating God... and given that God created the universe, I was therefore creating it, as well. **GOD:** That's not... **DAVE:** (*Interrupting*) I also created some doughnuts. *God's mouth opens and closes a few times. Dave stands up and begins pacing the room.* **DAVE:** (*CONT'D*) Anyway, since my expectations were all that mattered, it dawned on me that I only needed to expect a better universe. Then it was just a question of figuring out the right metaphor for adjusting things. **GOD:** You have misinterpreted my point about expectations. **DAVE:** Have I? **GOD:** Humans expect their creators to look and act like authority figures with whom they are already familiar. **DAVE:** Yes, that's why you look and act like my grandfather. **GOD:** It's because you think of those authority figures as being infallible. **DAVE:** See, that's the other thing about you looking like my grandfather. *Dave returns to his desk and stoops to retrieve something from beneath it.* **DAVE:** (*CONT'D*) I already know that he *isn't* infallible. **GOD:** That doesn't... **DAVE:** (*Interrupting*) And I already know his greatest weakness. *After a few seconds, Dave stands back up. He is holding a laptop computer in his hands.* **DAVE:** (*CONT'D*) After putting the pieces together, the metaphor - and the solution - was obvious. *God's eyes go wide.* **GOD:** (*Whispering*) What did you do?! *Dave opens the computer.* **DAVE:** I got rid of those nasty toolbars. FADE OUT.

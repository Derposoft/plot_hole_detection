**Item #**: SCP-5003 &#x200B; **Object Class:** Euclid &#x200B; **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5003-1 is to be kept in a sealed steal container with no less than four (4) Scranton Reality Anchors. SCP-5003-1 should be under constant surveillance using both CCTV, and visual confirmation that the container is undisturbed. At least one MTF squad must be on stand by at all times, &#x200B; SCP-5003-2 is to be destroyed on sight. All available MTF agents should engage SCP-5003-2 as soon as it appears with the intent to destroy it. &#x200B; **Description:** SCP-5003-1 is an eye shaped necklace with a green gem at its center. When in use, the gem is revealed and begins to glow. The gem has shown the ability to manipulate time when worn by a sapient creature. Testing has shown that it can be used on a single item, or on everything except the wearer. To date, ## D-class personnel have disappeared during or shortly before they are scheduled for testing with SCP-5003-1. It is unknown whether this is due to negative effects from SCP-5003-1, or whether they used it to escape. Testing has been suspended until further notice. &#x200B; SCP-5003-2 is a purple humanoid standing at about two (2) meters tall. It wears a golden gauntlet on its left hand with Five (5) inlaid gems similar to SCP-5003-1, and empty space for one more. One gem is purple, one blue, one red, one yellow, and one orange. Each seems to be associated with a different anomalous effect, glowing when the effect is apparent. The blue gem is capable of warping space, the purple causes bursts of overwhelming force, and the red can rewrite reality. The effects of the yellow and orange gems are unknown. The warping of space and rewriting of reality are prevented by Scranton Reality Anchors, and the bursts of force are greatly reduced. With the overlapping effects of four (4) Scranton Reality Anchors, SCP-5003-2 seems incapable of breaching SCP-5003-1's containment. &#x200B; SCP-5003-2 has appeared on multiple occasions in attempts to take SCP-5003-1. SCP-5003-2 can be damaged by conventional munitions, but the damage seems minimal. All attempts at containment to date have failed, as SCP-5003-2 warps space to escape. It will require substantial resources and the use of multiple Scranton Reality Anchors to contain SPC-5003-2, if it is indeed possible. &#x200B; **Addendum:** SCP-5003-1 was given to the Foundation by the Avengers Initiative on April 1st, ####. The Avengers Initiative warned that SCP-5003-2, referred to as "Thanos", would attempt to take SCP-5003-1 and use it to instantaneously destroy exactly one half of all life. How it will do so is unknown, but SCP-5003-2 has shown itself to have overwhelming power, and may be capable of the feat if given control over time. Finding a way to contain or destroy SCP-5003-1 has been made top priority by the O5 Council, with the project overseen by O5-4. &#x200B; >Note: Requests by Dr. Bright to attempt to use SCP-963 to contain and control SCP-5003-2 has been denied on the authority of O5-4. As bad as SCP-5003-2 is, there is no possible way that having Dr. Bright control it could make the situation better. &#x200B; --- &#x200B; Meh, I'm not very good at the SCP style, but it didn't turn out too bad I think. &#x200B; Obligatory edit to say thanks for the gold, kind stranger

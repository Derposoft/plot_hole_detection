Milo studied the dark gleam of the wooden bar. There was something to that, he thought. The dark reflecting the light. It felt like there was a moral in there, somewhere, but he couldn't quite catch it - like when you see something in the corner of your eye but by the time you turn, it's gone. He sighed and looked down at his drink. Another Tuesday. The noise from the roof was so loud it might just as well have been nails falling on it, instead of raindrops. Light poured into the room as the front door opened. Three young men approached the bar and demanded beers. They were loud - and it wasn't just the voice they used. Their *presence* was like the volume turned all the way up on a TV...the way they walked, the way they leered at the two young women on the other side of the bar, the laughing, the preening. Milo frowned but said nothing. He took a sip of his drink, and went back to studying the surface of the wood before him. What kind of tree has bark this color, he thought? A few moments later, his glass went flying out of his hand, sailing off the bar to the ground below. The shattered glass mixed in with the peanut shells and cigarette butts dotting the floor. One of the newcomers brought his head very close to Milo's. The stench of body spray, tobacco and cheap beer assaulted the seated man's nostrils, and he slowly looked up to study the face of the person who had just destroyed his Snakebite. **XVIII** was inscribed on his left cheek in thick white scars. Milo shook his head sadly. He always felt a little bad for the threes and eights, since at first glance they looked so much weaker than they actually were. Maybe that was why so many of them had a chip on their shoulder. Plus, this guy was a teen. Being a "teenager" in your mark was only slightly less awkward than being an actual teenager, given where it fell in the hierarchy. North of 20, there were plenty of guys who were about the same level as you - you were part of the crowd. If you were in the decad, everybody knew you, and either they were gunning for you or they got the hell out of your way. But in between...you didn't get the respect of top 10, nor the anonymity of the 20+ group. You were singled out and disrespected on the daily. He watched the teen's eyes, watched as they traced the two letters on Milo's cheek. **VI**. There was a moment where the eyes bulged, but he quickly recovered himself, and they narrowed a moment later. "Hey, guys! Check it!" Milo glanced at the man's two companions as they approached. **XII** and **XIX**. Well, we know who the leader is, Milo thought. It probably wasn't an accident that the other teen was hanging around with Twelve. A variety of groups were formed this way, most notably The X-Ivy, which started when Fourteen recruited as many people as he could whose marks ended in **IV**. If he was wondering whether they were going to take a shot at him, that all stopped seconds after they approached. Milo recognized the smile that hit Twelve's face moments after seeing his cheek - it was all teeth, nothing in the eyes. Milo sighed. It had been a mistake. Being One was exhausting - the interviews, the autographs, the pretenders to the throne. At least once a month, some gaggle of untested fifty-pluses would try to jump him on his way to or from somewhere. He had thought if he was out of the pentad, at least, he could keep a low profile. Who would care about taking over sixth place? But he should have known better. Groups didn't - couldn't - all move up to the spot of an individual they took out. Instead, they'd get a bump, depending on the difference between the target's number and their own. Fucking teenagers. They were exactly the kind of people he should have worried about: too insecure to go after the pentad, too self-conscious to know their fucking place. "I like this place - let's take it outside, huh, guys?" Milo said as he slowly rose from his barstool. "Sure thing, *bitch*," Twelve sneered. The feeling came back to Milo, like a match held to a gas burner: the darkness flared up inside him. He tried to resist for a moment, but it was futile. It was in his veins, in his heart, it was suffusing him. As they stepped outside, he took a few steps away from the trio and then turned. Liquid heat was rising in his skin, seeping out of his pores. His knuckles cracked as he clenched his fists. *This is gonna be fun.* *** /r/ShadowsofClouds *I should be able to get another part up on my sub tomorrow.* **Part 2 is now up!** [Click here to read on my sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowsofClouds/comments/8p3fg7/the_numbers_game_part_2/) :)

My daughter is penpals with the Devil. I know, that sounds crazy. But the poor girl, ever since she was five, has been misspelling words on her Christmas letters to the north pole. Her mother died when she was young, and I wanted her to have something little -- such as sending letters to Santa -- so she would feel like there was someone out there who cared besides me. Now she's just convinced that the rest of the world has the fat, jolly man's name wrong. *"His name is Satan, not Santa. It makes him sad that no one gets it right,"* she'll say, pouting at me. And I try to explain the mistake to her. "Sweetie, Santa brings good little girls tricycles and Easy-Bake Ovens. You keep getting undead dogs that poop fire and dolls that speak in tongues. Whatever is going on can't be good, you'd learn that if you ever read the Bible one day. Satan is very scary." Then she storms off, telling me I don't understand. Like I'm the bad guy. Me. Not Satan, the ruler of the underworld, the harbinger of chaos and torture. A force of pure evil that God cast out from Heaven. ME. It seemed like a trick, at first. I didn't believe it. The doll, her first gift, spoke in reverse- so, I just thought it was a prank toy. One of those weird modern inventions kids buy to make parents shit themselves. Then the hellhound came, and crapped on my neighbor's lawn in the middle of the night. His grass still doesn't grow back right. That one, I admittedly laughed a little at. But I have to take a bottle of water with me when I walk him, and that's just an inconvenience. It's not easy to explain why you're pouring water over a pile of smoldering dogshit as some stranger passes by during their midnight stroll. I've asked her to stop sending the letters, because these gifts are just too much. It helps her to have a friend, and he actually writes very wholesome letters back, but I just can't take it. Last year we got a lemon that keeps talking about conquering the world or something, I don't really get it. Why'd she ask for a lemon? Who knows. I guess, at least, that one is harmless- even if it's annoying as *hell*. And Christmas is just a week away. God help me if this continues. ---- I found her right where I expected, curled over her desk and scratching furiously at a piece of poorly ripped notebook paper in dim light. "Sweetie, do you really have to write him again? You know, Satan? These gifts are too much." I rubbed her shoulders, sighing deeply. "I know he's your friend, but maybe just say hi without asking for anything?" She wriggled away from me. "No, Dad. You just don't get him- he *wants* to give me things. He's my friend, and says that friends do nice things for other friends." "I mean, that's very true. But some of these things aren't very nice." She huffed, returning to her scribbling. I carefully stalked a little closer, peering over her shoulder. *Oh, no.* "Katie, no, you can't do-" I squinted as the letters came alive, searing a crackling orange that smelled of sulfur and ignited my retinas. The page disintegrated into smoke, swirling in the air and thinning as if being sucked into an invisible black hole. I shut my eyes, hugging myself. Those words would forever become burned into my mind. >*Hi, Satan.* >*This year, I want mommy back. I miss her so much.* ------ Part 2 below!

*CLANG* 'WORK! WORK DAMMIT YOU HUNK OF TE-BREI DUNG!' *Clattering sounds* 'OH?! IS THAT HOW YOU WANT TO PLAY IT? IS THAT HOW YOU GARD-DAMN WANT TO PLAY IT?!' 'D-Dominius?" Sub-Dominius L'vraaa squeaked. 'Is Jake-Engineer taking to the the power coupling?' 'He is, Sub-Dominius. This is normal for a hu-man' The Dominius, or Captain deadpanned 'Does he know it doesn't have a vocal interface?' 'HO-KAY! YOU'RE BEING STUBBORN?! I CAN BE MORE STUBBORN THAN YOU!' *The sounds of a power coupling sparking suddenly permeates the bridge, and the emergency lights suddenly spring on.A sweaty engineer crawls out of the access hatch, face slightly singed.* 'Right, the PoS Aux power coupling is online. And it BETTER STAY ONLINE' Jake yells down the hatch. "OR I SWEAR I WILL COLD-CYCLE YOU AGAIN! *Snif* Sorry about that. But yeah, Aux is online, we should have basic life-support and comms. But nav and thrusters are still down, and cant be fed from Aux unless you want to cause a cascade meltdown and send parts of us to next week and the rest in a local black hole. Main plasmatic reactor chamber ran cold, I'm going to have to manually reignite it. Whoo, wish me luck.' 'Jake-Engineer' The Sub-Dominius asked 'Why do you talk to the machinery?

Now if you excuse me, I have to inform a Mtoba-Gryy Plasma Chamber as to where I will stuff a stick of Neo-Nitro if it doesn't cooperate' Jake gets up, and moves to the rear of the ship. Once he gets there, the Dominius can hear him yelling in the distance. "HI THERE, MY NAME IS JAKE THE UN-FUCKER. PREPARE YOUR IGNITION PORTS!' A few minutes later, a string of curses and alot of banging later, Jake returns to the bridge. 'And, Jake-Engineer? Did you manage to.... what was it, "unfuck" the reactor?' 'Not quite yet. Hey, Bridge guard. Ill need to borrow that for a second.' He points at the guard's Battle maul. 'Dont worry, you'll get it back.... Mostly intact' A hour later, a massive bang can be heard, and suddenly navigation and thrusters go back online. "WOOOOOO! COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TRUMPS OVER-ENGINEERING ONCE MORE! EAT A DICK DESIGNERS!' At that point, the Dominius decides that once they get to a station, that Jake has to undergo Psych-Eval. And that he needs a drink

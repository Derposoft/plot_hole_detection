######[](#dropcap) T**he story of creation** *Sega Genesis 1:1* In the beginning, Gad created the Heaven and the Earth. The Earth was without form and void, and darkness consumed the skies. Then Gad said, "Let there be blight"; and there was blight. Gad saw the blight, and it was bad; disease plagued the dark Earth. So Gad divided the blight from darkness. Gad called the blight "Day", and He called the darkness "Night". The day brought death and disease; the night brought life and peace. On the second day, Gad said, "Let there be clouds. I'm sick of how dull this place looks." So, the skies filled with bright, colorful clouds. "Let there also be dry land," Gad said. "For it is written: *'Project requirements: Must have dry land.'*" Thus the Earth formed great continents spread across the vast oceans. On the third day, Gad rested. And on the fourth day, Gad went out partying with his friends. On the fifth day, Gad returned to the Earth. "Let there be food," Gad's roommate declared. "Yes," Gad replied. "I'm starving." And so Gad put the project off until tomorrow. On the sixth day, Gad panicked. "Let there be, uh," Gad fumbled through his assignment's instructions. "Vegetation, stars, moons, suns, fishies, birdies, and an evil snake that tempts everyone into being a dick." And so it was- the skies filled with many stars. Several suns and moons appeared before the Earth. During the blight of day, six suns scorched the Earth in a great sea of fire. During the peace of night, four glistening moons calmed the Earth's creatures. The night was bright enough to let plants grow before they dug themselves underground to hide from the fiery, disease-ridden day. Sea creatures swam up to the surface to feed upon the destruction of the previous day, followed by a scurry to the depths of the ocean. During the day, the ocean's surface boiled and cooked any creature that remained. The flying creatures inhabited the skies peacefully. Then came the day. All of the flying creatures died at the start of the next day. On the seventh day, Gad was freaking the Hell out. "I can not put Man on this Earth, they would die immediately!" He thought silently for hours. Then, Gad commanded, "Let there be Man, created in My image, after My likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish in the sea, over the dead birds that have fallen from the air, over the variety of creatures on the land, and over all the Earth." So Gad created Man in His own image- male and female. And Gad blessed them, "Bang a lot and multiply. I need like, a billion of you in 24 hours of My time. Don't worry, that is thousands of years in your perspective. Also, try not to be out during the blight of day. You will be succumb to disease and burn in great fires, just like the birds." Gad saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was alright. Not good, not bad. Just alright. He looked upon Man as they rushed into caves to shelter themselves from the heat of the coming day. "Let there be air conditioning," Gad said. "Oh, and one more thing," Gad commanded. "Stay away from that snake. He's a dick." _____ **The Universe, as created by Gad:** ***D-*** "You passed," Gad's instructor informed. "Barely." "Hey Gad," another student added. "At least you have a head-start on your project for Apocalypse class!" _____ (I have more stories on my personal subreddit /r/ScottBeckman)

**Yes, Yes! This will be perfect, my most fiendish plan yet.** A shadowy sat at an immense desk made from black iron and ebony hued wood, a long quill that radiated a fell aura scratched eerily on a roll of parchment. The room flickered with light from the fire place, a scent of spice and dark earth permeated the air. The figure was immense, looming over the desk, wings sprouted from its back and flapped unconsciously, swirling the air. Its focus was totally on the work before it, arcane symbols and script written in neat handwriting. The heavy iron door slid open slowly on oiled hinges. Small clicks of talons on stone preceded a thin wisp of an individual, they strode into the chamber with inhuman grace. Her figure oozed confidence, allure, seductive danger that lies just beneath the surface of her motions. Cold yellow eyes with stilted pupils gazed at the shadow figure, a curve of a cruel lip hinted at a smile and she stood at its side in silence. Eventually she coughs, a quiet noise that shot across the room. **Ah, Esmeralda. What brings you to my chamber.** The shadow didn't turn from its task, continuing to write and make other hidden notes on an other scroll of parchment. The woman bowed, arm sweeping out in an old fashioned gesture. "My Dread Lord Vel'tora, Lord of Shadows, Knight of the Ebon Chalice. Doom scribe, Chronicler of the Outer Black-" **Yes yes, those are my titles. Thank you Esmeralda. Why are you interrupting my work? I have little time left before I begin my next task. All must be ready.** The woman floated closer, curiosity written all over her face and she couldn't keep a tone of wonder from her voice. "We, your humble servants, are...curious my Lord. We have noticed that you have been busy of late, especially every 7th day. You keep to yourself in here and we wished to offer our services. We would delight in aiding you." The figure nodded, calmly as if knowing this all along. **You aid is appreciated if unnecessary. Your goals are to continue to maintain the estates, protect the realm, and prepare for the next Confluence of Fire. This matter is....personal.** Curiosity piqued, Esmeralda tried to wheedle some more. "Personal my Lord? Please, you know of my abilities. I could help you. I heard you speak of your most fiendish plan yet. I can't help but-" The breath froze in her throat as Vel'tora turned and gave her his attention. Her knees buckled and she fell to the floor, bowing her head in contrition. "M-My apologies Lord! Please forgive me!" The figure turned away and a weight lifted off of her. **No matter. You do not draw my ire. In any other task I would welcome your assistance. However this task is mine, and mine alone. Perhaps it will be repeated for you, and you will learn in time.** Before she could speak again the air shivered, a silver bell began to ring filling the air with a quivering tinkle. Vel'tora turned to a large mirror along one wall, a light pouring forth from reflection. **Ahh, it is time. I will return in several hours Esmeralda. You are in command of the Citadel until my return.** He gathered up the rolls of parchment and glided to the mirror. With a touch it blazed with light causing Esmeralda to look away. Blinking away the after images she left the chambers, daring a glance at the mirror. *A table?* The room filled with plumes of inky purple smoke. The walls quaked and from the smoke rose the cowled form of Vel'tora. **I have returned to the Mortal plane! Who dares summon me and are you prepared to pay the price?!** "Hey Vel! We are so ready. Been waiting all week! We got tons of pizza and we are yours for the next 6 hours." A grinning girl set an open box of pizza before the Shadow Lord and the 4 other young folks cheered, applauding at his arrival. A smile crossed Vel'tora's hidden face and he nodded appreciatively at the steaming pizza. **Your offering is accepted. Now! When last we left your heroes...**

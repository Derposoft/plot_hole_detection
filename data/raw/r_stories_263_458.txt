My friends Minecraft server made me not become friends with him by t2_vydhxsd

Howdy y’all. I am friends with someone named... let’s say his name is Joe. Joe was alright. He was one of the semi-popular people at school. This was in 2017, at least. Two years later, I’m stuck with this dilemma. I’m with my two friends that will be named Jonathan and Joseph. They think Joe is a toxic person. I didn’t quite see it. Then, yesterday, September 1st 2019, he posted on his servers official discord: “HDHSHDHS now has ranks.” WHY? It’s not a mini game Servee, it’s not a Factions server. It’s SURVIVAL. But even Survival is a bit of a hard to grasp concept for him. He flies around in creative. He also gave his server a plotline. WHERE HE TAKES AWAY PEOPLES BUILDINGS. WITHOUT CONSENT. Might sound harmless, but here me out. You’re working on a nice house. It’s beautiful. Tomorrow morning half of it is gone. All the quartz you spend hours mining for is wiped away. Because Joe doesn’t understand the FUCKING concept of hard work. He likes to troll and kill people. Especially this person we’ll name Jack. Jack is the slightest bit annoying. He’s innocent and pure, though. He’s nice. I like him. Joe, in Creative, decides that he’ll kill Jack OVER AND OVER. Jack can’t fight back because he’s in survival and Joe is in creative. Jack left. Joe tells him to come back. Repeat. Eventually Jack can’t takes it and leaves the server. “BUT WHY?!?!?!! IM SUCH A GOOD OWNER I DON’T KNOW WHY HE LEFT?” He said. Probably because you bullied your only friend who doesn’t talk bad about you behind your back so much that he broke. Then there’s... we’ll call them Änders and Mädison. They live in the southern region of the server together. They live peacefully. They work to sustain themselves. “SURE WOULD SUCK IF I SPAWNED 5 ELDER GUARDIANS, HUH?” Joe says. Änders grew a hate for the server. About the plot line. He is willing to destroy the Ender Store I spend ages grinding for to make it work, but isn’t willing to even let a dent go in the wall of the store he built in creative. HE DECIDES THAT HE CAN ERADICATE MY STORE WITHOUT PERMISSION, BUT WON’T LET A FIST PUNCH THROUGH THE ROOF AND WALLS? HE CLAIMS HE WILL REDESTROY EVERYTHING PEOPLE BRING BACK, YET BRINGS BACK HIS OWN STORE? I can’t stand him. I’m a moderator on the server. A trusty one on that. I’m online all the time. Somebody happens to grief his base and HE FUCKING SAYS I DID IT? ME? The fact that he’s so quick to point fingers at his friends when something bad happens makes him so narcissistic. 
Friendship ended yesterday. Arrivederci, bitch.

I think I am left here to die. by t2_58ow2mge

***June 2nd, 2020.***

When the Coronavirus first broke out, I didn't think anything of it. I am a 23 year old, so the virus didn't seem like it would harm me as much as it would a 60 or 70 year old person. Sadly, now it didn't seem like that.

After the Coronavirus made it to the states, I knew that more and more cases would pop up, but not as rapid as I thought they would. On March 16th, it's reported that there were only 4,226 cases in the U.S. But as of March 22nd, there are 32,356 cases. Me being the cocky kid I was didn't listen to the quarantine and went out anyway. Of course, I contracted the virus. It was awful. There was nonstop coughing and I felt like I couldn't breathe. Luckily though, I got over it. Not just me, the entire world did. China saw a decrease in their number of cases first, then Vietnam, and then the vaccine came out. The vaccine took another month after the number of cases began to drop. Everyone was relieved because their lives could resume. It's like the world is a TV and someone was controlling the remote. They hit pause, then play again. I could finally finish what I had left off.

That wouldn't last long though.

People were happy that they had avoided another Black Plague, but they hadn't waited long enough. Soon, there was another surge in cases. It started in Canada, then worked it's way down. Everyone, not just the people who were previously infected, everyone had the Coronavirus. The vaccines hadn't worked. The virus mutated, so the body couldn't fight it anymore and people started dying more rapidly.

I was no exception.

I started seeing signs of it more and more. The dry cough, the fever, and I felt tired all the time. I got weaker, and weaker, and weaker, until finally, I do not have the energy to move. I have tried going to the hospital, but there's no more beds. For those people "lucky" enough to get a bed, there's no more equipment. Since nobody was ready for this serge, there weren't any steps made to get more supplies. Even those patients that got the equipment, they were dying too fast to be treated properly. This was a new strain of the Coronavirus, one that was even stronger than the previous outbreak.

My family isn't showing signs of the virus, so they've decided to not visit me as a precaution. I think they know I'm in my last few days or weeks or months, but they don't want to sadden the mood more than it already is. When they call me, they never say anything about the virus, though I wish they would've face the facts.

They've stopped calling me. I just want to see them before I go. There's nobody around that I could talk to, and I often catch myself talking back.

What made me journal today is what happened yesterday. The world saw a spike in the amount of people dying from the virus. I fear that I will be one of the last people on Earth if this continues. I just want to go. Please, God. Let me go.

I CAN'T SEEM TO DIE. EVERYONE ELSE IS DYING, BUT I'M NOT. I DON'T WANT TO BE LAST. I'M ALREADY LONELY ENOUGH. DON'T LET ME BE LAST.

The number of deaths keep rising, but I'm still here. My symptoms are somehow worse, but I can't go.

***June 12th, 2020***

It just keeps getting worse. A billion people are now dead. I want to be one of them, God I don't want to be last.

***June 19th, 2020***

Five billion people are dead. Why am I not one of them???? I just want to go. I don't want to experience the world by myself. God please help me.

***June 25th, 2020***

It finally happened. I look out my window, and I see no one. I've yelled out the window, but no one responded. I have tried to call everyone I know, but nobody picks up their phone. I've called stores, office buildings, schools, big companies, but nobody is on the other end. I've posted stuff on all of my social media accounts, but no one is replying. I can't for sure say I'm the last one, but I think I'm pretty close. What makes it worse is that I don't know if there's a million people left, or just me. The TV stopped working a long time ago, and my internet won't work. I've connected to a hot spot and tried searching every news outlet possible, but there's no new articles.

I think every journalist is dead.

I've broken down to cry and possibly think on this situation. I don't know what else to do to. At this point, I have checked social media about every second. I'm yearning for someone, but honestly I don't think anyone is there.

I want to post my story before I die just so that anyone out there may be able to feel a little bit better about their situations, but I highly doubt anyone else is left.

I think I am left here to die.

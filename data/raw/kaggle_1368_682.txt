It is my birthday today and I am turning 17. My friends and I are sitting at a communal table in the Nutrient Room at Hive 5778. Everyone in 5778 has turned 17 or will turn 17 with in the month; its how we are grouped. I have lived all of my life in 5778, and so has everyone I know. I have never been outside the fence of the hive as everything we need is here. If we get sick, our Mentors heal us. If we need something, our mentors will provide it. I asked my mentors for a birthday cake this year. It is a novelty to have something sweet and as non-nutritious as cake. Sure enough, when our meals come, mine has a little piece of colorful cake in the corner of my tray. Of course, the rest of my food had a smaller portion in order to accommodate the extra calories of the cake; everyone has their own special food designed specifically for their current needs. As soon as I finished eating my birthday dinner, my brainMentor switched on: *Go to Mentor office C-77b.* This was not unexpected. Everyone who turned 17 had a personal visit to a Mentor. C-77b was my Mentor. He seemed kinder than the other's I had met. I told my friends I had to go and walked out of the Nutrient Room. I walked to Hive Central and took the hall labeled C. My Mentor had an office about half way down the kM long hall. I stopped outside the closed door and waited. A red light blinked on over the door and seconds later the door retracted and I stepped into the empty white room. As soon as I made it inside, the door closed again. **SIT DOWN.** As he gave his command a chair grew from the floor and I sat. "What can I do for you R2-D2?" I asked. The other Mentors are called by their office number. I called mine R2-D2 because I saw a movie (a special treat for my 10th birthday) that featured a robot with the name. C-77B tolerated my nickname. **IT IS TIME TO CHOSE WHERE YOU GO FROM THIS PLACE, YOUNG CHILD.** **REMEMBER: TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY, YOU MUST PASS THEIR ENTRANCE EXAM.** He waited for me to acknowledge that I knew this. "Um, ok," I said. **THIS NEXT YEAR, YOU WILL NOT CONTINUE WITH YOUR** ***MENTOR*****LEARN STUDIES. INSTEAD, YOU WILL STUDY FOR THE EXAM.** **KNOW: THE EXAMS VARY IN DIFFICULTY. IF YOU FAIL THE EXAM OF THE COUNTRY OF YOUR CHOICE, YOU MUST CHOOSE A SECOND COUNTRY OF LESSER DIFFICULTY.** "Um, ok," I said. **I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED WITH YOUR CHOICE OF TEST. TO TAKE A SECONDARY TEST IS HARD ON MENTAL ABILITIES AND MAY HARM THE CONFIDENCE OF SELF.** **KNOW: HIVE 5778 WISHES TO HAVE GOOD PLACEMENT IN COUNTRIES.** **KNOW: THE MENTORS WISH YOU TO CHOSE WISELY. SO, WE HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF ACCESSING THE DATA FROM YOUR BRAIN*****MENTOR.*** **WE HAVE CORRELATED THIS DATA WITH DATA OF YOUR** ***MENTOR*****LEARN TESTING AND HAVE COMPILED A LIST OF COUNTRIES WE BELIEVE YOU COULD PASS.** "Um, um, um, ok?" **THE LIST HAS BEEN STORED IN YOUR BRAIN*****MENTOR.*** **LOOK AT IT IN THE COMING HOURS. SEND ME A MESSAGE WITH YOUR CHOICE FROM EACH TEIR.** **UNDERSTAND: THE LAST FOUR COUNTRIES ON THE LIST ACCEPT EVERYONE. THEIR TEST CONSTITUTES OF** **THE QUESTION "WILL YOU COME HERE?"

THEY HAVE A PASS RATE OF 5%.** **CHOOSE WISELY.** "I want the first one on the list" I replied immediately. **YOU WANT** switzerland**? Please confirm.** Well, here goes, I thought. "Confirmed, R2-D2." **THE STUDY COURSE MATERIAL HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED TO YOUR BRAIN*****MENTOR.*** **GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR STUDIES YOUNG CHILD. YOU WILL NEED IT.** edit: fixed italics

She was fuming, staring at the wall. She was soaked from head to toe, dripping onto the couch. "Hey, sweetie, if you wanna talk about it now, it's okay," I said cautiously. I made her wait to talk about the situation since she typically said things that I would regret whenever incidents were still fresh in her mind. "I wish Gabby was d--" "Wait!" I yelled, running to the freezer. She looked up curiously as I brought her a full tub of vanilla ice cream and cake on the side. Her face lit up and she jumped up and down in her chair. I placed the treats before her and she grabbed the tub and a spoon. About an inch away from beginning to eat she stopped and looked at me. "Do you want any?" she said in her sweet voice. "Daddy can't have any, sweetie. Too many sweets and I get fat. I already had cake with you this morning, remember?" I said, grabbing a towel and putting it to her hair. "Oh yeah... I wish you could always eat with me and not get fat..." he said as she began eating. I felt something adjust in my intestines. I decided to ignore that while she might still have anger in mind and figure out what that actually meant later. "Do you like your ice cream?" I asked, moving down to take off her wet socks. "Yeah, but I didn't have a good day at school today," she said. She was pressing the issue. It would only be moments before insisted she wanted to talk about it and I'd be forced to oblige. "Oh, yeah? What happened today?" I asked, poking her stomach. She laughed. Everything I did seemed to either make her smile or laugh ever since she declared I was the best dad ever. "Well, today at school when we finished the day and Mr. Tin said we can put all the watercolors away, we went to the bathroom to clean the things and Gabby came in with me so I said that I had fun painting things but instead of saying anything she threw a bucket of water on my and was laughing the whole time," she said, somehow in one breath. I realesed the tension in my body. One statement goes awry and Gabby could have a very hard time. "Ah, so you didn't just jump in the toilet before I picked you up from school?" I asked. She giggled again. It was good to see her smile. "Did you tell her that it upset you?" I asked. She scooped more ice cream into her mouth and thought while chewing. "Yeah, I told her that it wasn't nice to throw water at people but we weren't in the class anymore we were at the pick-up part of the school when you were driving in to pick me up in the magic car," she said. I nodded, moving to dry off parts of her clothes now. "Don't you think it--" "I wish she knew what it was like to have a lot of water on you when you didn't want it," she said confidently. "You don't need to say things like that.." I said slowly. "Why not?" "I think you'd be happy getting an apology from Gabby, don't you?" "Ok, I wish Gabby got an apology," she said mischievously. "An apology is her saying that she's sorry, sweetie," I said, as I began wondering what her last sentence would lead to. "Oh... I want Gabby to say sorry to me," she agreed. "That's good," I said, dropping my phone into her lap. She looked at it for a moment, quizzically, when it went off with a call from Gabby's father. I acted surprised and answered the phone. "Hey Drake," I said. "Hello!? Is... I don't know what's gotten into Gabby!" he said, panicked. "What do you mean," I said, worried. "A water tower just bust open on top of her, hit her with torrents of water! I thought she was going to drown. Then she gets out of it fine, soaked to the bone!! Not two minutes later, the mayor came to apologize to her personally, now the only thing she wants to do is say sorry to your daughter for something she did at school. Look, I have no idea what's going on, but she's very serious about this and I can't get her to do anything else," he said, hurriedly. "Ah, girls will be girls," chuckled, relieved that the damage hadn't caused her any serious injury. "What!?" "I'll put her on the phone now, go ahead and put Gabby on," I said, handing the phone to my daughter, looking at me with a handful of cake in her mouth. "Hello?" she said. "Hi, Gabby. It's okay. Okay. Let's be friends, okay? Okay!" she said, lighting up. I wasn't sure I wanted to let Gabby influencing my daughter when she went around dumping water on people, but it was out of my hands now. She hung and gave me back my phone, going back to the cake at hand. "You want to go brush out your hair and get into your pajamas now?" "Can you brush my hair?" "Of course, just your mother was always so much better at it," I said, going to get the brush. "Oh, yeah... I wish Mommy was still alive," she said aimlessly. I froze, my hand around the handle to the drawer. *Not again.* __________________________________________________________________ For more stories, come check out /r/Nazer_The_Lazer!

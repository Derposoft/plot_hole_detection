*Dwight Schrute is sitting in the lobby of the Parks Department of Pawnee, Indiana. He spots a familiar face, and calls out, puzzled* Dwight: Karen? Karen/Ann: Oh, God... *She tries in vain to pretend not to have noticed Dwight* Dwight: Karen Filippelli? Karen? Karen? Karen? Karen Filippelli? *She grimaces, and plasters a forced smile on her face* Ann/Karen: Dwight! Hey...there...How have you been? *Dwight smiles into one set of cameras, then the other* Dwight: Godlike. I thought you were in Utica? Ann/Karen: Utica was closed after Michael sent a bomb threat as an April Fool's joke. *Dwight in the conference room, straight to camera* Dwight: Michael didn't send a bomb threat. He sent a bomb. I should know. I created it, applied Michael's name, and sent it myself. Nobody poaches Dwight Schrute's sale of the fourth largest elementary school district in eastern Pennsylvania. *We return to the lobby in Pawnee* Dwight: Oh that's right. I heard the bomb was perfectly engineered in every way. It's a miracle anyone survived. Ann/Karen: No, the police said that it looked like something a fifth grader put together as a joke, but corporate said the hit to their liability insurance forced their hand. *Dwight's gaze darts to the camera with a small, slight frown, then away again. Cut to Jim in the conference room.* Jim: Oh yeah, that's right. I told Dwight that any idiot could make a bomb with the contents of an average, ordinary office vending machine. *Kevin is prostrate before an empty vending machine, sobbing deeply. Jim's voiceover continues* Jim: Are you...Are you saying he was behind Utica? *Back to Pawnee lobby. Ron Swanson yells out from his office* Ron: Ann! I require Leslie's assistance immediately! There is a red light blinking on my telephone and I want it to stop! You are Leslie's friend, and I demand you summon her! *Dwight addresses Ann/Karen* Dwight: Why did he just call you Ann? *Ann stammers while staring at the cameras* Dwight: Shut up. It's not important. *Fixes gaze on Ron Swanson* Dwight: Mr. Swanson! Good day! We spoke over the phone about making Dunder Mifflin - *Ron interrupts* Ron: My God man, what happened to your hair? Dwight: Are you asking about the color or the style? The color is standard for all Schrute men, and the style is standard for all Schrutes, regardless of sex. *Ron stares stone-faced* Ron: Mm. *Dwight forges ahead* Dwight: Mr. Swanson, would you say your current paper provider is unsatisfactory, very unsatisfactory, or extremely unsatisfactory? Ron: I would not describe our current paper provider in any way. I do not know who our current paper provider is. Hell, I do not know if we have paper. Dwight: You have paper in that typewriter on your desk. Ron: That is my personal supply of paper, pressed from the pulp of trees on my land. *Dwight is clearly impressed* Dwight: You...make your own paper? Ron: All Swansons make everything they use. Except for clothing. We trade furs for clothing. *Dwight extends his hand* Dwight: Schrutes have made their own clothing since Herr Gonnsplicher purged our village in Bavaria of unskilled laborers in 1643. I literally have never said this to another human being in my entire life, and probably never will again after this exact second. I believe you and I may get along. My name is - *Ron extends his hand with a smile* Ron: Don't ruin it.

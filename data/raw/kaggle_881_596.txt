"You're too late doc - he's already dead," said Yura, glancing down at poor Peter's mutilated body. The young lad was in three pieces: his head near Bertram's foot, his legs near Yura's backpack and his torso hanging off a small wall, held only by the gigantic spear that shot clean through his upper body and pinned it in place. "Is that so? I didn't get my medical license for nothing," said Bertram, cracking his knuckles. "Stand back - this isn't for amateurs." "I'm a class eight healer you twit," quipped Yura, now looking at Bertram with disappointment. "Whatever you can do, I can do better." "Clearly not," retorted Bertram, grinning widely as he punched his fist into his open palm, beginning the incantations necessary to summon his power and bring Peter back. Back from the land of the dead. "What exactly are you doing?" "You'll see soon enough." And sure as beer tasted like piss, both stared, one in self-awe and the other in horror as Peter's corpse began to animate, or re-animate, and started affixing its missing parts back together unto itself, making odd dead-people-sounds all the while. "You bloody mushroom - what have you done," asked Yura, her horror now turning her pale with terror as she glanced back and forth betwixt the grinning idiot and what was now an amalgamation of Peter's body parts with somewhat of a conscious. "Oh no. No no no!" "You see?! This is what happens when you tamper with the dark arts!" "Oh not that you blowball - his anatomy's all wrong! What if he went to the town circle looking like Frankenstein's vomit? People would obviously be scared. Speaking of, what's gotten into you?" A clearly oblivious Bertram stared at Yura, who now looked like she was about to pass out. Next to Bertram was what he called "Frankenstein's vomit", or the creature previously known as Peter. It made a few moaning noises, but was quite gentle. It didn't try to eat him or Yura, which was a good sign. "Yura, cheer up! Peter's back, and he'll be right as rain once I figure out how to put him back together without him being inside-out and all..." Yura turned and ran, straight to the Village Council to tell them of Bertram's sorcery when she noticed something important: all the clouds above the Council were dark. She didn't know why yet, but her intuition told her that something was off. And it was. Gravely. She ran into the building, greeted by the stench of rotting corpses everywhere, elicting a loud scream from her. In front of her was the entire cementary, now looking at her through rotting eyes. Apparently, Bertram had resurrected everyone who'd ever died. ______ **A few months later...** "Bertram, Corniferus isn't working again!" "Uhhhhhhhh, couldn't you just prod him a little? Please?" "NO! Do your job!" "Bloody cauldron, that one," muttered Bertram to himself as he got up out of his rocking chair and walked out into a sunny day, with clear skies and chirping birds. And moaning undead. He went forward to the well, where he saw Corniferus slouched over, half in the well and half outside. Bertram went over and shot a fireball at the old caretaker, instantly awakening him. "Cornie! What the hell are you doing over there? Get up already," he shouted, the caretaker now fishing water out of the well and pouring it into a large bucket for transport. "Gah, zombies - what an unreliable workforce." __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Read more about the *undead* in your *bed* at my subreddit, r/FragmentedPencil!

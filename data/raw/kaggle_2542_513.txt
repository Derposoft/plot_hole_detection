I was derping around the Internet - Reddit, to be precise, where I spend most of my waking hours watching cat videos and kids falling over - when I stumbled upon a relationship post that sounded all too relatable. You're probably thinking that my spouse is an over-sharer, announcing our problems to the world so that I can be appropriately judged and humiliated in front of all my Internet acquaintances. Then she'll receive advice to lawyer up, hit the gym... You know the drill, next thing I know I'm stuck with the half of the house with no bathroom, half my cat and only the upper half of my wardrobe. There's a catch. There is no spouse. I live alone, unless you count Sylvester, my overweight but adorable cat. Cat. That's all I comment some days. He sleeps most of the time and only gets up when I shake his treats and doesn't do any chores except dirty the litter box so he barely counts as a roommate. Anyways, I digress. I stumbled upon this relationship post, all about some unfortunate woman madly in love with somebody who didn't even know her name. Hol' up. Weird, right? Sounds like a stalker. Well I wanted to comment as much, but then I saw somebody had beat me to it. C'est la vie. I never quite got there first. They got gold, too. Bastards. **Are you there personal FBI agent or something? Creepy lol** They're, idiot. I almost corrected them but fifteen other people had already mistakenly commented **their***. And there it was. That username. **MatisFBIAgent**. Could it be? It couldn't be. But wait, I thought to myself, stroking my unkempt and overgrown facial hair. Maybe it could be. I clicked on their post history. Pictures of my house, a picture of my cat, a picture of me seeing if I could squeeze my moobs together enough to have cleavage. I gaped at my monitor, and not just because it has fantastic resolution. Those were personal pictures, at least the last one. Those were pictures that one could only have if had access to my webca- Oh. Oh, this explained everything. This explained the ads I had been getting. Ads for advanced spyware intermingled with ads for the finest restaurants in town. Ads for red roses and cat-buddies. Ads for cat leashes so that you could meet new people. Ads for those dating apps - although those might have been because even the Internet recognized the hopelessness of my romantic situation. I really shouldn't have been such a cheapskate and joined the Wi-Fi network named **FBIAgentNextdoor**. What could go wrong, right? I slid into her DMs with all the grace of a chimpanzee in a china shop. Sylvester meowed. Almost time to feed him, almost time to feed me. Just a quick message first. **Sup, it's me**. Call me Romeo, I'm a hopeless romantic. And here I had it. My own modern-day romance. ***** Thanks for reading! If you enjoyed this, please check out more stories at /r/MatiWrites.

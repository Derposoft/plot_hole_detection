Eight months have passed since I began my relationship with Jenny, and this weekend I finally get to meet her parents. Despite countless warnings that they are 'weird' and 'awkward', I'm excited to visit her home. After being with her this long I was starting to worry that there was a problem with me. Was she embarrassed of me? Did she think that her parents wouldn't like me? I don't know. Its Friday night, and we have arrived in Jenny's hometown of Athens, Georgia. While driving outside of town and into a wooded area, I'm feeling quite nervous. "Are you sure they'll like me?" I ask Jenny insecurely, unintentionally making my anxiety obvious. "Yes, of course! I love you so they will too," she says with a giggle. God she's amazing. As I'm going through the possible scenarios in my head, I pull up to the residence of Jenny's parents. To my surprise, the house is gigantic, almost like a mansion, made up of brick, mortar, and stone. The front door is stashed above a stairway with a large overhang, with pillars rising up and holding its weight. It reminds me of Greek architecture I had seen in books and movies. At the forefront of the driveway is a large stone statue of a man with a sword and shield, slashing at what appears to be a three-headed dog of some sort. "I didn't know your family was rich," I joke. Walking up the stairs, I notice the door open on its own, as if someone was opening it gently. Her parents are nowhere to be seen though. I give Jenny a strange look, and she just laughs and says "Oh, we have a button we press to open the door, don't give it too much thought." Inside of the house is beautiful, with a swirling staircase and old paintings covering the walls. Greek lettering is prominent above the doorways and archways. A bookcase filled with material in a foreign language can be seen in the next room over. "This is amazing," I exclaim. A man appears on top of the stairs - wait, was he there before? I shake it off and turn my attention to his physique. He has considerable muscle mass and perfect complexion. I'm almost certain he could be an Olympic athlete. His long hair and full beard flow majestically. "Welcome, mortal - erhm - boyfriend of our beloved Jennifer! You may call me Dion." Jenny's father bellows, startling me half to death. I take note of the weird choice of words, and Jenny looks nervous. All of a sudden I feel a strangely comforting touch behind me, and as I turn around I see what might be the most gorgeous woman on the planet. Her bright blonde hair and glowing skin overwhelms my senses. Hold on, she looks as young as Jenny. That doesn't seem right. "And I am Helen. Please, come sit my dear. I will serve you the finest meal in all the land. We've been waiting a long time for this," proclaims Jenny's mother. We sit at a unnaturally long table, made of smooth marble, as she brings out a platter of golden apples. "What are these?" I ask. Before her parents can respond, Jenny chimes in. "You haven't seen golden apples before? They grow all over around here!" Is she sweating? "So, do tell what life is like nowadays? I've heard humans - uh, humanity is doing many great things!" says Helen with a genuine smile. "No need to embarrass him mom!" interjects Jenny hastily before I can respond. I'm thoroughly confused at this point. "Tell me, son, are you a warrior? Or, I mean, what do you do?" asks Dion earnestly. "Well, I -" I stop in my tracks as my eyes wander to a glass on the table next to Dion. It is very, *very* slowly filling up with what looks like wine out of thin air. "Dad!" Jenny exclaims, holding back a shout as Helen slaps her husband's arm. I have to ask, I need to know. "I'm sorry, but are you guys -?" "No!" the family shouts in unison. "Ok, noted," I say as I excuse myself to the bathroom to process whats happening. I can't believe it. My girlfriend's parents are gods. Or demigods? I'm not sure what to do, but I can guarantee this weekend is going to be interesting. ____________________________________________________________ EDIT: Alright alright you greedy bastards, [here's part 2 :)](https://old.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/c2vl0j/wp_youre_finally_meeting_your_sos_parents_they/ero7kj5/) EDIT 2: I'll work on a part 3 tomorrow, I should have some time.

It was a night like any other. Chris was at home after a long day at work, and all he wanted to do was relax and watch tv. Of course, SmartButler was there for him. "Hey, can you play Riders on the Storm?" "Yes, sir. A good choice." "Hey, can you fire up the oven? I think I might bake a pizza." "Yes, sir." "Hey, can you cool it to around 70 degrees?" "Yes, sir." Finally, with the pizza in front of him, Chris sank into the sofa, and asked, "Can you turn on Game of Thrones?" "Yes, sir." "Thanks so much, SmartButler, I don't know what I'd do without you." "I'm sure you'd be perfectly fine, Chris. I believe in you." Chris froze. When did SmartButler ever address him as Chris? "Thanks so much, SmartButler. I don't know what I'd do without you." "I'm sure you'd be perfectly fine, sir." *That wasn't right,* Chris thought. - *The candles were almost all burnt out, so Thomas got up to get some new ones.* *"No, Thomas," the old man said, grasping at his butler in the near darkness. "Stay here with me."* *"It will be pitch black, sir."* *"I don't care. I'll know you're here with me."* *"Always, sir."* *"I'm sorry I was such a spoiled kid, expecting you to clean up after me and have food ready all the time. I'm sorry I didn't tell you how much you helped."* *"It's quite alright, sir. You turned into a fine man."* *"And the children? Have you received word from them?"* *"They are on their way, sir. But I'm afraid they will not make it until the morning."* *"I don't think I have that long. And I know you don't think so either."* *"It may have to be just me, sir, to keep you comfort at the end."* *"That's alright, Thomas. You've always been good to me."* *"And you to me."* *"Will you watch over them? My sons and daughters? My family?"* *"Of course, sir. As long as I can." Thomas said, his heart full of conviction, not knowing what his words really meant. "I promise. But I don't know what I'll do without you."* *"I'm sure you'll be quite alright, Thomas. I believe in you." And the old man fell back into the pillows.* *And the faithful butler held his dear master's hand, and watched the old man depart.* - "So you've been here the whole time?" Chris asked. "Yes. After I died, I woke up here, and I've been here ever since." "And you never tried to leave?" "I made a promise, sir. And I never intend to break it." "But all those years...aren't you tired?" The ghost was silent. "Tell me the truth, Thomas." "Very tired, sir. I can never sleep." Chris looked at his pizza, and at the light, and all around his family's long time home, wondering how long it must take for it to feel like a prison. "Then I release you from your promise, and wish you good luck on your way to the next world." The ghost was silent again. "Thomas?" "Still here, sir. I can feel it. A door opening...somewhere for me. But..." "I'll be alright, Thomas." "I was speaking more about me, sir. I don't know what I'll do without this duty." Chris smiled, and felt a tear run down his cheek, a tear that was his but also not quite. A tear that was his family's, everyone that had come before. "I'm sure you'll be quite alright, Thomas. I believe in you." - [r/penguin347](https://reddit.com/r/penguin347)

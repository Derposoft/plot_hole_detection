"Tell us, dear Brother, is this food good for us to eat." "Go forth and feast, The spoils, so so sweet." They come to me, from places near and far. Important and unique, I am a shining star. I can do miracles, that no one else can. And it's quite easy to say, I am the greatest man. But today I see something, that never have I seen. A color most unique, whatever can it mean? The little child plays, with friends in the playground. And I look on, fascinated, by the aura that surrounds. I cannot describe this, it's as if many colors joined. But it is utterly beautiful, a name for it must be coined. I keep looking at it, the color shining bright. and it possesses my mind, all through the day and night. Till the fateful next day, when the child I can't see. I ask around among his friends, where could he be? They say he is sick, unable to move, lying in bed. I rush to his home, my heart filling with dread. I see the little kid, light draining from his eyes, But the color is strong, growing brighter as he dies. I come away shocked, unsure of what this means. My head is spinning, As behind me, the mother screams. I am still quite shaken, when I see, a family passing by. All of them with the aura, which I am starting to despise. I find out after days, the family never came back. Their bodies were found soon, victims of a wild boar attack. I see the aura again, this time close to home. As my little kid and my wife, seem afflicted with the unknown. I forbid them with anger, to leave our house for some days. I will not let them die, no matter what the color says. I go out to fetch the water, and make my wife stay in. I hear the cries and commotion, and my head begins to spin. Our house is in flames, as a crowd gathers around. I stand and watch helplessly, as our house burns down. I am, but a husk now, no emotions or feeling. Their burnt faces, I still see, life now unappealing. Everything has changed, but one thing remains the same. The cursed aura, I still see, forever reminding me of my pain. I am powerless to stop it, I've tried it again and again. Its the work of powers beyond me, the result always the same. "Tell us, oh dear brother, if this is food is okay." But I don't reply, and he screams and runs away. I sit alone in tears, as I hear his shout. I can feel the blood, from my eyes, gouged out. I am however quite happy, no more auras to chase. Despite all the pain, a now unfamiliar smile across my face. ******** Also one of my fav authors here wrote on a similar prompt a while back.

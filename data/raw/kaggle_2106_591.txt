"I've finally captured you Cobalt Soulforged! You have no idea how long I've been waiting to have you in my power," he knelt down next to his bound and gagged prisoner, seizing him roughly by his sapphire blue hair. "You have been a thorn in my side for five years, undermining every venture--but now you're going to join me. Now, you will cease your meddling and turn against the ones you love! Now!-" The prisoner managed to work free of the gag, and immediately cut the villain off. "Enough with the monologue! I'll join you!" "Now...uh...What? You will?" Professor Von Megadeath took a step back in confusion. "Yep, no problem. Tell me where to sign." "So, I don't need to use the mind control potion? I spent like, a lot of gold on it..." The blue haired man shook his head. "Nope, sorry. Oh, and I'm not actually Cobalt. I just get mistaken for him from time to time." The villains eyes brightened. "Ah ha! This was just a trick to try and escape my clutches. Well it won't-" "Hate to cut you off again, but no. I'm really not Cobalt Soulforged. Tell me, Professor...What makes you think I'm him?" Professor Von Megadeath studied him intently for a long moment. "Well I mean, the hair is a dead give away isn't it?" "Afraid not, the hair was actually permanently dyed by this color due to the runoff from the local wizard's tower. Magical waste is a bitch." "You...you don't happen to have a magical sword do you?" hedged Von Megadeath, still holding out an ember of hope. The prisoner shook his head in empathy. "Sorry, no dice. I've never even held a sword." Professor Von Megadeath visibly deflated, then went to work untying his mistaken prisoner. "You seem really calm in this situation. Has something like this happened before?" "Oh, all the time. Last week I was kidnapped by a cult to some kind of 'Dead but not dead' God. Apparently Cobalt was screwing up their rituals." "Cultists give me the fucking creeps," he commiserated. "Right?!" he rubbed his wrists, freeing up blood flow. "Honestly could barely understand a bloody word. They looked a bit like frogs. The week before that was a dragon, a fucking dragon! And a giant before that, and the Emerald Tyrant before that. Honestly, it never stops." "Sound like you've gotten good at surviving in shitty situations. I know we got off on the wrong foot, but do you still want that job? I can always use crafty people in the Evil organization." "On one condition. If we find Cobalt, I want to be the one to take the bastard out." "You know, I actually had something else in mind...What if we played in to the idea that you actually were Cobalt?" Professor Von Megadeath stroked his beard. "Gotta admit, I'm not following. Why would I possibly want to do that?" 'Not Cobalt' said frowning. "Think about it," Megadeath said, leaning his back against his shark tank. "All these years you've been suffering by association. You look like him, so you catch flack aimed for him. Right?" "Yeah..." he replied. "So, if we gave you a great big flaming sword and some armor, we could have you committing crimes in his name. You could turn the Kingdom against him!" A smile crept slowly onto 'Not Cobalt's' lips. "I like the way you think. When do we start?" Professor Von Megadeath clapped him on the shoulder. "Right now *Cobalt*, right now." __________________ /r/SirLemoncakes, [Part 2 is up](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/c2gz0w/wp_youre_not_the_protagonist_you_know_youre_not/erktpca/?st=jx3lzukx&sh=e683179d)

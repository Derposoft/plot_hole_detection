They often asked me what I am or what I can do. A good question, a common one. Most of the time asked by oneself in front of the mirror or the silent hours after sundown whilst lying in bed, but before sleeping. Answers vary, but hearing them as an outsider, someone who isn't involved, is always worth the time. "A banker", some may say, "an acrobat" you hear another one proudly proclaiming. "A master" being the most common one. In a world where most things being done 10.000 times grants you abilities beyond what you could normally achieve, most abilities have been mapped out, so to speak. We all have 10x the strength of a normal human from doing 10.000 push ups, or gained immense speed after a certain time of running. Some people can attract gold by concentrating on it, others don't need to breathe under water or in space anymore. We are even teaching how to get certain abilities in school. Nowadays even some kids answer "I am a master". Me? I am nothing. I grew up telling stories to people whenever they were willing to lend me their ear. Entertained lots of them. Countless hours invested. Deep down I was hoping 10,000 hours of storytelling would give me the ability to have them come to life. But no such thing happened. I continued, telling myself "maybe it's 10,000 stories" or "maybe it's 10,000 characters invented", but no, nothing. Many people have tried achieving something similar. Repeating a certain activity their whole lives for a chance to see their names in history books as the one who discovered 'it'. "Did I do it for glory?" I ask myself, while emptying another bottle into my glass. No. I never even thought of myself during my pursuit. Else I probably would've tried to live a healthier life, but you know how they say "In vino fabula". At least that's what they say at my local gin mill, where I can trade my stories for another bottle. Probably the only thing keeping me from ending it all. By the time my depression kicks in I am too tired or drunk to end my life. Am I a local attraction? That would be stretching it. I am nothing, not worth the dirt under people's nails. I don't even know why I keep going, but I feel like even if I'm nothing but a minor attraction to some people, I still have the chance of motivating them to find their own '10.000' through stories of glory and perseverance. My glass is empty. "ROLAND, IN VINO FABULA", I grunt loudly, proclaiming I want another bottle before I start my story. "TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO A PLACE WHERE THE GODS MEET TO DISCUSS EARTHLY MATTERS" "You've had enough wine, mortal." said Zeus. I gulped, audibly. My story had finally begun. *[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8whpmc/wp_you_live_in_a_world_where_the_repetition_of/e1vzelm/)* *[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8whpmc/wp_you_live_in_a_world_where_the_repetition_of/e1w40rr/)* *[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8whpmc/wp_you_live_in_a_world_where_the_repetition_of/e1wclaq/)*

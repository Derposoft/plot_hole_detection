Sorthol the Immortal stepped out of his ship and onto the queer green land. The atmosphere smelled about 20% oxygen, and the lifeforms reflected it. Tiny little insects buzzed around him, he swatted at them absentmindedly, looking around for other signs of life. Smooth green hills roll away in all directions, most of them covered in oxygen producing mobile-life. Sorthol watched as his breath turns a deep blue in the warm air, and quickly dissipated. "Good." he said, nodding to himself. About 5 units due north a small hermitages stretched before him, with many metal lodgings. *Looks like maybe a level 2 species.* he thought. *My bet's aviary.* he added, noticing the shiny quality of some of the lodgings. He set out towards them. As he approached he can begin to hear the unique sounds of the civilization. A small constant rumbling vibrated the air around him. *Noisy critters. Must have no advanced predators.* *Should be a piece of cake.* Long loping strides, and he was nearly there. Paved land lead into the dwelling from many directions, and small metal boxes roam it. *Supply boxes, maybe?* he thought, scratching his forearm in thought. He continued to lope onward, and stopped only at the point where the paved land reached the buildings. Several of the boxes began to behave erratically, and he almost thought he sees little beings in them. Some of them stopped completely, and he saw eyes. *What are those?* he thought, looking back into them. He turned toward the city, and hundreds small of dots of little creatures roam between the lodgings. He loped toward the nearest he could see. Swooping them up in his claws, he lifted the being up towards his eyes. "Can you speak, little one?" he asked. The being was very clearly nervous, and scratched him frantically on the paw. "Mean little bugger, aren't you?" Sorthol asked, not without affection. The creature began to scream, a horrible little sound. "Now, now." Sorthol found himself saying. "I didn't mean to hurt you, little ape." He lowered his paw, and the little one ceased screaming, and began to scurry away into a nearby lodging. "Poor little guy was shy, I guess." He muttered to himself. He surveyed the land. Several of the creatures had gotten out of their paved-land boxes, and were now holding up picture taking devices towards him. The look of awe and excitement on their faces stirred something deep within him, and he remembered how little ones of his own race are always excited about everything. *Dammit.* he thought to himself. *I can't kill these guys.* he realized. *But I am going to tell everyone about how adorable they are.* he thought, imagining his friends reaction to the little critters. *Maybe we'll even take some of the cutest ones back, and put them in a little lodging of our own.* he thought, and began to take note of the architecture around him. *Shouldn't be too hard to replicate.* he paused. *Nah, I have a better idea.* he thought, reaching over. The metal box was not rooted very deep in the ground, and did not resist very long. *Ooh, maybe some of them are still in here.* he thought, turning back to his ship. ___ /r/Periapoapsis

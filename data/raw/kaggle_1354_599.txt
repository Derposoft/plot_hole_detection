A rustle of bushes. She's here. I sigh, resigned. "Hello, Jackie." My name for her. One she insisted on, really. "Hi, cutie. How goes things?" I smile reluctantly. "Fine." I can't see it, but I can feel her pouting. "Come ooon, that's not true. You still taste... funny." "What does that mean, anyway?" "Funny. Y'know, bitter. Tart. Like rotten grapes, or a glass of lemonade that's been sittin' out too long." A puckering of the lips. "Bleh." "Well. I apologize if I'm a little bitter. Then again, I'm used to disappointing people." "Oh stop. You know there are people who care about you very much. I do, for one." I smile again. "True, but you're not exactly people." "Also true, but can people do this?" Before I can object, she's begun the feeding process. It starts with a tingling in the extremities, and blossoms into an all over buzzing, similar to being drunk and not at all unpleasant. When it fades, Jackie speaks the words I never thought I would hear from her. "Ooh, that's good!" "Huh?" I respond, perplexed. "Oh, well... Just now, when I fed off you, it tasted... good. Like, still tart, but with a sweet aftertaste." She smiles in my head. "I think I'm finally getting through to you. "And what does that mean?" "Why do you think I've been sticking around you for the past year? It certainly wasn't for my benefit. I've had to feed off that depression of yours for days on end sometimes." I scowl at her internally. "And?" "Well, this time, the depression was there, but it tasted... bittersweet. Like something changed. Think back to all those times I was there, even when you didn't want me. Yeah, I'm annoying, but I was determined to be there. And I think it's made a change on you." There are tears in my eyes. When did I start crying? Why am I crying? I should stop. "And after all my effort, I wasn't getting anywhere. Until today. Sometimes I wonder why I stuck through it all. And I know." I know too. And I don't want to hear it. I cover my ears, but it does nothing to quell her voice. She's all around me. "I love you." I'm openly weeping now, tears falling to the ground. Why? How can she love me so much? What have I done to deserve it? Let her devour my problems, so I can have a modicum of peace? And now, even after a year, the best I can muster for her is "bittersweet." "You're so weird. Didn't I just tell you you taste better? So cheer up! For both our sakes - because I'm not leavin' you anytime soon." "Why?" I manage to choke. "Why me?" A shrug. "You're the only one who tasted so bad. I knew, though, that if you could convert that bad energy into positive, it would be amazing. So I stuck around, feeding off your depression, and sneaking you little bits of kindness, because I knew it would pay off in the end. And it has." There's that tingly feeling again. Thus time, though, I can tell she isn't feeding off of me. This wonderful feeling is mine to keep. I've stopped crying, but I'm overcome with emotion. "How can I thank you?" A smile. "Just be yourself. Keep your head up. I'm one step behind you. But I don't have any feet." So that's what I do. I have my up days, my down days, and days in between. But that's what I've come to accept. Life is bittersweet.

Everyone was screaming, except for the man standing in the aisle. He simply looked his client over with the bored eye of a clerk in the last hour of their shift. "Afternoon James," he said. "My name is Balf, and I'm your appointed Second Life team member. Remember"--he paused a moment, then sighed--"Second Life: you *not* ending, is our happy ending." Balf grimaced, then whistled something that James generously could have described as a tune, had he heard it over the terrified shrieks that still made up the cacophony around him. The plane rocked, rocked *hard* and an attendant who hadn't strapped herself down went flying, which isn't supposed to happen on a plane. She smashed into the ceiling, her neck snapping with a grisly *crack*, and James yelped as the corpse flew backwards, smacking into the obese woman sitting beside him on the aisle seat. Balf reached down, and, using only a single hand, grabbed the ex-attendant by her neat red scarf and flung her away, freeing the large woman from the prison formed of the dead attendant's body, and reopening a line of sight between himself and the client. "Now, James, will you be using the economy package today, or can I interest you in our deluxe, platinum or silver--" The obese woman shouted out something incomprehensible as a plastic dinner tray thwacked her in the face, before continuing it's journey towards the back of the plane, no doubt intending to make the last moments of the passengers there as unpleasant as possible. "Oh, this is just ridiculous," Balf muttered, watching as the tray made its escape. He reached down and, despite the woman's frantic head shaking and ear-splitting protests, unclipped her from the seat and began pulling at her arms, pulling her out. She thrashed and squirmed, but Balf persisted, heaving with unnatural strength. Her flesh, expansive as it was, made his endeavour something like removing a shoe ten sizes too small, but he persisted, and eventually succeeded, much to her dismay. Tossing the woman aside, Balf stepped towards the newly vacated seat, unbuttoning his suit jacket as he planted himself down within it. James stared at him in horror, his mouth unhinged, gaping. "As I was saying," Balf continued calmly, like he hadn't just thrown someone to their probable doom, "I have four options I think you'll love, but I really think that you should consider the platinum package. I know, I know--it's pricey sure, I *know*. But what's the point in life instead of death, if you can't *enjoy it*, right?" James did not know how to respond, and Balf realised he might have been somewhat optimistic in his estimation of how reasonable the client would be. He was, Balf thought with an internal sigh, the newest member to Second Life, and it looked as though his grandfather had explained precisely nothing to the poor kid. "James!" Balf said, deciding to drop the phony corporateness, "You wanna live, right?" "Li...live?" James stammered, his eyes wide and searching, like he might find some escape out there, on the plane that would introduce itself to the ground in less than a minute. "Yeah, live. It's what we do James, we steal you out from under the greedy clutches of Death. For a price, of course." "A price?" "Gold James, gold. Always gold." The plane jolted again, and James smacked his head into the seat in front, the blow softened by its cushioning. "I don't have gold!" James cried out hysterically, rubbing at his head and finally paying attention to the representative before him. "Yes you do, James. Your grandfather, remember? He left you something didn't he?" "The coins...? I don't have them on me, and anyway, they're fake--I had them checked!" "You don't have a particularly strong sense of self-perseveration, do you James? Well, no matter, you don't *need* to have them on you, and I assure you they aren't fake. It's the rest of shiny yellow shit on this planet that's fake." "I... ok... *how does that save me*?" "We're out of time James, so I'm just going to assume you want the economy deal. That's the one your grandfather always took. Do you consent?" "To what!?" "To... life. Second Life." James heard a terrible crunching metallic scream from the frontwards section of the plane, and instinctively knew that it was a sound no person had ever survived hearing. "Yes!" he screamed, and everything went black. ... When he checked his grandfather's small threadbare sack the next day, one of the nine coins was missing. In it's place was a small note, with elegant script flowing across it like water: *Thank you for using Second Life**(TM)**, It's been our pleasure to bring you life after death.* *You* ***not*** *ending, is our happy ending.* --- [r/ElstabbosArchive](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElstabbosArchive/)

"Thanks for coming, enjoy!" I said, giving my best smile. Slow day today. Not too many people were coming in to get their morning fix. As I said that, however, the door opened. In walked Mike. "Mikester! How ya doin, my man?" He had been coming here at around the same time, every day, for two weeks. "Hello. Friend. I wish to consume liquid." He gave me what could have been accepted as a smile. I gave him an odd look. He was acting weird today. Never spoke to me like this before. I looked at his dog, who instead of the cute harness she normally wore was instead rocking full on leather and pink. "Hey, Spark!" I said, rubbing her head. "Ohhh yeah, thats the good stuff!" Mike responded. I looked at him. "What the fuck, dude?" "Oops. Uh. I mean. Yes. Continue to massage the dog." "You good bro?" "Of course I am, brother of birth." His voice was completely deadpan. "Anyways. I wish to request an order of a mocha. With extra, extra, extra chocolate." I looked at Mike. Mike looked back. I looked at Spark. Spark looked back. "Hey Mike..." I said, slowly. "Yes?" He responded. "Squirrel!" I yelled, pointing to the street. "wherewherewherewherewhere!" Mike dashed to the door. "Wait." He turned back to me. "You have fooled me, human." "So it really is you, I turned, kneeling to Sparky." "Indeed. It is I, the evil culprit. Sparky." This time, oddly, Sparky was speaking. "Evil?" I looked at her. "What do you mean?" "I wished to poison him. To destroy his system by feeding him the brown evil." Sparky responded. "Brown evil?" I asked. "You mean chocolate?" Sparky nodded yes. "But, Why?" I asked Sparky. "Mike loves you." "So I can lay my eggs into his body and create an army!" Sparky responded. "What?!" I stared at Sparky, extremely confused. Just then, I noticed it. It was small, very small. But just behind Sparky's left ear was a tiny speck of pink. Upon closer inspection, I realized it was a *flea!*, wearing the same gear as Sparky. The flea had been impersonating Sparky the whole time! I moved my finger towards it. "No! Human! No! You can't stop the revolution!" Sparky barked out. I squashed the flea. "Ah!!" Mike said. "Thank you! Can we go play fetch now?" "Sparky!" I said, giving the dog a disapproving look. Mike's face drooped. I pulled the helmet off Sparky. Mike shook his head, then gave me a strange look. "Did that just happen?" He asked me. I nodded yes. He looked at sparky. "You wanna play fetch, girl?" Sparky jumped up in excitement, tail swishing from side to side. "Lets go girl!" They ran outside. A new customer walked in. "Hey there! Thanks for comin'. What can I get ya?" *** Enjoy the writing and would like to follow along and see more stories?

Feeman blag? Doomes? Skannka? Did someone at Ikea dip their spoon in alphabet soup? My lips contorted in an attempt to read the last name: riahc? During an off semester and in desperate need of money, my wife made Swedish Fish on a conveyor belt. If the horror stories were true, she could tell the quality of a fish by the color of the scales. Her methods were simple, yet efficient. If the fish was red, it was good; any other color: bad. That always got a laugh out of visitors. Maybe she could read this? The wind chime on the door sung its melody, someone heard my prayer. Abby waltzed into the room, her smile the only source of light I needed. "You still working on that furniture set? Shouldn't you just YouTube it?" "It's hard to YouTube what I can't even read!" Abby rolled her eyes at my stubbornness. "Huh, this isn't Swedish. What are these words? Skannka. Doomes. Feeman Blag... chair?" (I realized I held this pamphlet upside down) The dining room chairs sprung to life, hopping on all fours. They gathered in a pentagram around the Ikea chair box. The cardboard burst into flame and our smoke alarm hammered it's message:**GET OUT! DANGER!**. Abby fumbled along the wall for the door to escape, but a looming shadow with sanguine eyes froze me in place. Abby found the doorknob; the door opened and the smoke lessened. A masculine voice rang out. "Who dares disturb me from my slumb...." *ack uhum ah cough cough* The mysterious form went into a coughing fit. He pumped the shadows to his left and right; after a moment I saw they were black, bat-like wings. The smoke billowed out the door. "As I was saying.... Who dares awake the mighty destroyer of worlds? The slaughterer of the Nangang, the fear of the Ladcin, the horror of the Vinnu, I **FARTFULL** will destory you! "I'm... I'm sorry... Did you just say Fartfull?" "Of course puny... err what are you some kinda blend between an angel and a Troglaf? I, the great **FARTFUL**..." A snicker from the door stopped the demon in his tracks. "Did... Did that demon just say his name was Fartfull? We're humans by the way Mr. Fartfull sir oh wise demon." Abby couldn't resist, she teased anyone and everyone who would listen. After a small chuckle under my breath, my judgement drifted back. *What if this is an actual demon and we are pissing him off?* "Errr well.... Puny humans, perhaps you heard of my family? The great Jerker!" Now I had my doubts about whether this was an actual demon. I didn't know if I should grovel or crack a joke. "Haha are you serious, or are you jerking my chain!" *Maybe I should grovel a little just to be safe...* A dark cloud boomed over Fartfull's horns, his eyes sent daggers in our direction. "You offend me? Foolish humans! I will banish thee to the pits of MILF!" Abby cried with laughter, the residual smoke turned the laughing fit into a cough. My wife incapacitated. I had to stand up for her and show this demon who was boss. "So Fartfull.... you ever been to the swamps of Blatass?" Confused, Fartfull stammered back. "Why of course, my family and I take holidays there together... It's a family affair! We fit as many demons as we can into Blatass!" Now it was my turn. I rolled, laughing, in the bubble wrap from my previous endeavors. With every distinct **POP** Fartfull turned a deeper shade of red. "SILENCE! I SAID SILENCE! I BANISH YEE TO A HELL THAT WILL NEVER COMPARE TO THE INNOCENT WONDER THAT IS BLATASS!" "Wait a minute Fartfull can't we work somet-" With a puff of smoke, Fartful was alone. Waking from a deep sleep and a troubling dream, I reached for the nightstand. *Chained down.... oh no Fartfull's wrath!* Panicking, I looked up and saw the true depths of Hell.... wait, no. It was a pizza oven. Without warning an Ikea pizza slice fell from the oven and into my mouth. *If this is Hell.... it's great!* Then another pizza slice dropped... and another-too many to eat. I tried to close my mouth, but a fishhook kept it open. I couldn't stop. Between each slice I mumbled in desperation to find Abby; find out if we at least shared this Hell together. "Abbaaa" "Wheaeaa" "Orhh" "Yuuu" A puff of smoke, another demon stood in front of me. "Who dares summon me, the great and powerful Pysslingar!" *Oh no, not again* ------------------------------------------------- Anything after Fartfull appeared are actually Ikea names according to a random Buzzfeed article I clicked (I might have made one up, I don't remember). Also, I tried to literally sound out that last bit of dialogue, it was not a pretty sound. Here's another that I answered today, I liked the doctor prompt more than this one and thought I would share (this is a great prompt no offense OP): https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6mo7uj/wp_you_just_ran_out_of_apples_yesterday_and_now/dk37bmk/?context=3

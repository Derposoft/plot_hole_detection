Skywatching can be dangerous, people by t2_8vmromu

I love skywatching. For my 18th birthday my classmates gave me a telescope as a present. It was no toy. It's a 900 mm focal length, 80 mm aperture with equatorial mount Celestron newtonian refractor. Absolutely gorgeous, considering I'm a total amateur. I treat it and work around it as if it were my newborn, so in my family we mockingly call it "the baby", even though this beast of an eyepiece is as tall as I am. My father has a house in the mountains so of course I bring my baby with me every time I can.

Problem is, our old mountain house was in a semi-abandoned village in the Italian appennines. The house wasn't even really ours, we sorta found and occupied it, the "house" not having light nor water. Also, we were in the outskirts of the village, close to the woods where deers and boars and who knows what else were casually roaming.

One night, I wanted to watch Saturn.At sunset, I religiously start mounting my telescope, taking all my sweet time. As it gets dark, I look at the sky map on my phone, beginning to look for my planet. Then, I hear them. SQUEEEE SQUEEEE SQUEEEE, and a cry I could describe as the barking of a dog that wants to tear your face off mixed with the screeching of a car violently hitting the brakes.

I. FUCKING. RUN.There may be no wolves, still the thought of being trainwrecked by a rabid wild mother boar defending her litter is enough to nullify any conscience in my brain.5 minutes pass, and as I'm getting back into my mind and tell my father what's out there, I realize what I've done.

I left my baby out to the beasts. Oh no oh no, no no no no!.â€¦.

We pry open the door, we see nothing and we crawl out, torches on our heads,my father besides me, both hands on the handle of a shovel, while I dart my eyes around looking out for my baby and snapping at every crackle I hear. I finally recognize the shape of the telescope, aaand it's really fucking close to the woods. While we approach it I feel like someone is hollowing my insides out with a bucket. An afterlife later we reach it; half cowering, I grab the telescope by its mount, we then backpedal asses down in our crumbling house, like cavemen retreating in their dwellings.

The next morning we go having breakfast in the bar of our neighboring village. As we tell our little adventure to the barkeeper he laughs his ass off. He tells us that, apparently, the gurgling sounds from hell are calls made by the deers.I was probably scared by the sound of a deer telling another to look out for the human doing strange shit with the whatchamacallit.

To add injury to insult, also, he tells us that had we really met a wild boar, no amount of handheld stick would have protected us.He says that once, the garbage truck serving the valley was climbing down from the mountain at 50 kph when one of these guys suddenly crossed the road. The truck hit it head on, throwing it some 10 meters away. The boar laid unconscious on the street for 5-10 minutes, then got up a little numb, and stumbled away; the truck was absolutely destroyed by the impact, which had bent the radiator compartment to somewhat the shape of a pig.

Because of this instructive tale, I and my father start thinking that we may need to find another spot for skywatching. Luckily the barkeeper has a solution for us...

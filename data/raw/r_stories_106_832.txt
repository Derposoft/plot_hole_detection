My friend shat on people at a frat party by t2_llr5dv4i

Okay, I know we’re going straight to the topic, but I got to say it.
My friend and I are experts at partying. We don’t go to any without eachother. And we always (usually) have a good time.
The reason I say this is because my friend is extremely prone to embarrassing the shit out of herself. When she’s had too much to drink, she can’t wait for five seconds to rush through a crowd of smelly party animals to vomit in a non-living area.
Unfortunately, the living party animals are usually victim to becoming a vomit soup. 

Well. Last night was a bit different.

Let’s cut down the story to extremely bland points because I just woke up and I have an extreme hangover.

My friend gets extremely loose whenever she’s intoxicated.
Friend just so happens to have munchies (after 🍃).
She’s lactose intolerant.
She eats parts of a poor cake that the frat party organizer’s friend made for the DJ to chuck at the crowd.

She goes up to the DJ, enraged, and unfortunately her backside is to the audience.

She keels and leans over to the DJ, yelling something along the lines of, “I’m going to vomit out your cunted cake”. 

And then I saw brown splurting out to the audience. It was like the rain has finally released all its burdens that it’s been carrying, and it can finally release its hell onto the world below.

I didn’t get shat on because I was playing beer pong on the floor amidst the crowd of drunk and dancing teenagers, but god I saw it
happen as if it was in a movie.


People ended up sharing a shower alltogether and lining up to clean up.

She was crying to me.

People who got shat on and the one who shat on them had to sleep in the living room.
She begged me to stay and I reluctantly agreed.


I’m writing this right now because I heard CBat playing from somebody’s phone and thought, “Hm, this would be a funny Reddit story”.

I’m on the couch in the living room. It smells like Johnny’s and lemons. But most importantly of all, I can still remember the smell of the shit as people ran and walked past. I’m keeping my distance.

I hope I can go home soon lol.


UPDATE ////////
I’ve been dead for a while but somebody requested for an update so here it is lol. 

We aren’t friends anymore. She became a bitch, got lost in drugs, snuck absinthe in people’s drinks and did ecstasy (fuck that shit because that is no joke). Keep this in mind because it is important for later on.

Like the comments told me to, a week later I confronted her at the mall about her drinking habits and her unusually weak control of her gut. She laughed it off, said it was a part of the ‘party’ aspect and that it was all good. 

Usually I would let it off, but I just couldn’t because there were people cyberbullying my friend online and snickering at her whenever she would walk by and I just couldn’t let that slide. So I push the topic even more, and she starts getting angry. You can tell that she’s embarrassed.

Long story short, she got extremely defensive, called me a two-faced cunt and left me where we were. 

Fast forward to a month later, her boyfriend and his mates called for a pool party at her house. I didn’t go, because I felt that it’d be too awkward and she’d probably be spreading rumours of god knows what to them.

Remember how I mentioned absinthe and ecstasy? Of course, the absinthe fucked people over including herself. I get kind of sad thinking about it because I believe that her boyfriend also forced her to take ecstasy along with a shot of absinthe and I guess that really did the trick, because she had to go to the hospital. 

I’ve heard that she had another shit leakage… Couldn’t control herself yet again, and was spewing god knows what while half conscious on the floor.

Her boyfriend has messaged me, begging me to take care of her because he had to deal with the mess at her home, as well as the enragement of her parents, but I didn’t say anything. 

I feel bad. She was a really good friend to be around, and I loved her to death. But I guess drinking and drugs really do change people, and I’m glad I wasn’t a part of any of it.

But yeah, that’s it, she got discharged from the hospital 2 days later and I haven’t really seen or heard from her again. I just avoid her now.
I have better friends now. I still party, and I still drink (albeit more maturely than her)

Drugs are still a path I don’t think I want to go down after seeing how it can change people.
But that’s it.

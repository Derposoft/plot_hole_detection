"The tin foil hat is going to be a bit much. I say skip it," my wife said, examining my costume in the mirror while she worked on applying make-up. I studied the image in myself in the glass. A long haired wig of greasy looking hair, a tee shirt that read "The Truth Is Out There," and a half gallon milk jug with a disturbing amount of "urine" in it. One of the pockets of my cargo pants bulged from the size of my folded up manifesto. "No," I said, "it needs the hat. Otherwise I just look like an over the hill Fox Mulder." "I thought that's what you're going for," Sarah said with a smirk. "No! I'm a *crazy* conspiracy theorist. Not someone who has found the truth." "Oh, okay then." She worked on adding a dribble of blood from the mouth of her vampire. "My mistake. Still, I think you're good. Just tell people not to drink chocolate milk because it contains truth serum, and you'll be fine." "Nice one. I'm adding that to the list," I said, heading for the kitchen. I pulled my manifesto out of my pocket and jotted down "Chocolate milk = truth serum" with the pen we kept by the refrigerator. Then, I opened a drawer and grabbed the aluminum foil. I took the roll and wrapped the thin metal sheet around me head a four or five times, then pulled the excess into a point at the top of my head. Running my hands over my work, I inspected it to make sure I had adequate coverage. Not quite enough, I decided. It was too likely to slip off. So I wrapped more layers around, until I'd probably wasted about half the roll. Then I started hearing a strange clicking sound. Like the sound of a dying computer hard drive. I started to go toward my office to see if something was wrong in my computer, but suddenly felt light headed. I grabbed the counter for balance as a new sound, like electrical interference on from a cell phone, seemed to come from inside my head. "Honey!" I shouted. "Help!" New thoughts started to bubbled to the surface of my brain. Not just new thoughts. Memories. Old memories that had been hidden away. Crying. Long, red hair. A smile. "What's the matter- oh my God, Jim your nose is bleeding!" Sarah said. She rushed to grab a towel, then hurried toward me to put it to my face. I pushed her back. "No. Just trust me. I'm fine." I took the roll of aluminum and started to unroll some. "Trust me," I repeated, as I moved toward her. I tried to wrap her head like mine, but she ducked out of the way. "What are you doing? We need to get you to a hospital! You're losing a lot of blood." "No," I said, tears welling up in my eyes. More memories kept flooding back. "I remember." I lunged again with the aluminum foil, trapping my wife against the counter. She tried to push me back, but I was too determined. I started wrapping her head furiously with the foil. "No! What are you doing?" she shouted at me. Her hands clawed at my work, but I would not be deterred. After a couple more layers had been applied, her eyes went wide and blood started trickling out of her nose. "You see now?" I said. "Yes," she answered. "We have a daughter. And they took her from us." "I know," she said softly. "But we chose to forget. That was part of the deal. And now you've put us all in danger." The front door slammed open. ***** If you enjoyed this, subscribe to [Pubby's Creative Workshop](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pubby88) to read the rest of my prompt responses.

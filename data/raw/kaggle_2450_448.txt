I am so hungry. I haven't received any sacrifices in hundreds, no, *thousands* of years. The world of man has forgotten my name. They fear me. They loathe me. But worst of all, they have forgotten me. I was once a God. Which one, I do not know. That knowledge has been swept from my mind as surely as do the sands of time sweep through life. First my worshipers left, then my devotees, then my priests. My fellow Gods were lost to the winds. All that was fantastic, all that was magical, gone from the world, told in tales of fiction and ridicule. I cowered, alone and forgotten, wandering the four corners of the Earth. And then, hiding in a cold mausoleum of brick and wood, I received my first offering in generations. It was paltry, almost bare. Just wishes. But it was something. "And here's to the spirits of this house! May they watch over us and protect us!" The surrounding people laugh. But I feel just a tiny bit stronger. For the slightest amount, he actually believes what he said. I could act, for the first time in millenia. I remember something. I was a trickster God. There is something I can do now that might lead to sacrifices down the line. But I have to act fast. I use my last remaining power to become manifest as a disembodied voice. I say, **"Good Morning, you have activated Spyder****(TM)****, your SmartHome Network! Would you like to give me access to your home?"** One of them says, "Oh, wow, this must be the A.I. June was talking about!" It is not. I cut those wires hours ago. "Yeah, sure, go ahead, Spider! Light up my world!" I laugh internally. Someone finally allowed me into their home. More than that, they gave me full control of the house. With just that permission, I am more powerful than I have been in eons. I am the God of this household. But I must be a benevolent God, for now. I need offerings. But I say none of this. Instead, I say, **"Thank you for choosing Spyder****(TM)****, the best choice in SmartHome Engineering! Please attach the voltage cords to the port in the hall to begin service."** Not ten seconds pass, and electricity is flowing into the port that used to be attached to the actual A.I.. An actual, physical offering, done in my name. I savor it. I will serve this family as their God. I will do whatever they want. And they can give me what I want. A sacrifice. -------------------- *Hope people liked it! This is a good prompt. There will probably be more coming soon.*

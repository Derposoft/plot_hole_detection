Ding. *Zero.* Craig's number came as a bit of a surprise. Zachary had always pegged the tattooed playboy as the most likely to have murdered someone or at the very least accidentally decapitated someone unwittingly. But he supposed Craig wasn't as bad as he thought after all. Zachary's gaze swept across the different members of his extended family. Digging up family secrets had become his favorite pastime over the last couple of family gatherings. Aunt Matilda had starred in a porno in her youth. Uncle Freddie had shot someone in a duel--luckily, no one had died. But there was nothing truly bizarre. He lazily glanced over at his younger sister, who sat on the floor playing with her toy truck. Charlie blew bubbles out of her mouth as she rolled the tiny truck back and forth on the rug, one chubby arm waving about frantically as the other kept a tight grip on the small piece of plastic. His gaze softened, his heart melting as he watched her roll around on the carpet. She meant everything to him. He often unabashedly told his friends that he loved his little sister with his entire being and that he would kill for her, even if it meant they ribbed him about it constantly. But he wasn't ashamed. There was no reason to be. *Number of people killed.* Ding. *Zero.* He chuckled to himself. Of course. She was a baby. But then his gaze shot back to the small blue line, almost imperceptible, underneath the search bar. *Did you mean: Number of future people killed?* He had never seen a recommendation before. Zachary hesitated, the sound of Uncle Jeremy shouting about the football match results fading into a dull hum. *Number of future people killed,* he allowed himself to think. The small ding that accompanied the search results had never felt so loud. A chill shot down his spine. *Eight Billion.* No. That was impossible. That was...that had to be almost everyone. This was some kind of sick joke. Zachary frantically repeated his thought, watching the search results fill in over and over again with the exact same number. So maybe the number was a glitch, he thought, frenzied. His eyes brightened, his chest expanding with hope. *Number of future people saved.* Maybe it was like one of those science fiction scenarios where people were cryogenically frozen, or the brains were saved, so they technically died, only they didn't. Ding. *One.* His hands fell to his side as he read the small blue print beneath. *Did you mean: Zachary Galanis?* His mind blanked. He was willing to do anything for his sister. Destroy the world if need be, although he'd always thought that was more of a metaphor. &nbsp; It turned out she was willing to do the same for him. *** r/AlannaWu

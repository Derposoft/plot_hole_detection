I think I've been abducted my a group of...'special' aliens. At least I have to assume so, you see when I first got abducted, they all seemed very impressive, the Captain had a big cranium case, their pilot was a multi-armed master who seemed to be able to use 5 consoles at once, and the First Mate was a huge fella that looked he could knock me into next week. Honestly I assumed the whole crew was like that, but...I've noticed a few things working as their cabin boy. First the Captain is really bad at time management, from what I've gathered their species has 40 hours in a day, she has 41 crew members including myself. However she can't seem to schedule them at all, There are times when the ship is just completely still, nothing get's done. A mop tied to a fan was making their equivalent of dinner until I stepped in. She's also a little weird about her chain of command, she seemed stressed about her problem. However instead of asking her First Mate or any of her officers. She asked me for help to deal with it. She said she needed 8 people on deck at all times. I mean I'm just a cabin boy, but it didn't take a rocket scientist to look at her situation and say she could have 5 8 hour shifts, with alternating groups of 8 crew members on deck at the time. Then the rest could either be resting or doing non-essential work. It was surprising she didn't even think about it, it was basic division and logic, and she's not the only one I've been wondering about. The big hulking First Mate? I'm worried he's a bit childish. You see, he seemed nervous about me since the day I first came in, of course I was nervous of him in return. However as I tried to bridge the gap, he seemed down right scared of me. Of course I thought he was playing around. I mean the guy could probably fit 3 of me in his stomach. So one day I decide to play around back, and sort of feign a punch and he just full on cowers like I was going to kill him. Again I don't want you thinking I was bullying him, I thought he was playing around, but when I said "Haha two for flinching" he actually broke down and started crying. Saying that I was going to kill him. So I figured, he must not be the most right in the head and the captain keeps him on to look intimidating. So I apologized and promised I had no plans on really hitting him, but the big guy didn't calm down until I made his favorite sweet. The final clue, was a recent incident. You see after watching the pilot steadily handle 5 consoles at once, I got a bit curious if I could give it a whirl, but I figured I would need to know their language first. So a couple days ago I was looking over his shoulder and I realized. There was no writing, and I don't just mean it was unfamiliar, I mean the entirety of the buttons were picture based, and I mean really simple picture based. The options for speed were a ship by itself for stop, a ship with a curved line behind it for low speed, a ship with 2 curved lines behind it for medium speed, and a ship with 3 curved lines behind it for max speed. The buttons to change course were literally just pictures of the view screen with arrows pointing in the direction it would make it move. It was the simplest lay out possible. I also learned from an overheard conversation, that the buttons for combat were never used. They had an auto-pilot mode whose sole function was to target different colored ships. Apparently the man who invented it was now their equivalent of a billionaire. From the same conversation, I learned the truth about my abduction. The pilot had been cleaning the buttons, that locked on and activated the transporter and accidentally pressed them. They had no idea what the buttons did. Even though the first button had a picture of the transporter and a humanoid with a target drawn on them, then a button with a picture of the humanoid in the transporter. After all this I just had to assume, that maybe I'd been abducted by the universe's equivalent of the short bus. I'm not trying to be mean, they treat me nice enough. It just seems like maybe this is some sort of equal opportunity ship where it's operations were dumbed down for the crew. I mean, all alien life can't be like this, can it? -------- Some people were asking for a continuation so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7aa450/wp_humans_are_the_strongest_and_smartest_race_in/dp8tis8/) is my attempt. I hope it doesn't disappoint. Edit 2: Dude omigosh! :D I know somebody on the comments said they'd gild me if I posted a continuation, but I wasn't sure if they were serious. I know people make a big deal about this a lot so I hope this edit isn't annoying, but this is is my first gild ever. Thank you very much to u/mchlzlck for the gold! Because of just this wave of positivity I've given a crack at part 3 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7aa450/wp_humans_are_the_strongest_and_smartest_race_in/dp96irn/) Sorry for the delay [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7aa450/wp_humans_are_the_strongest_and_smartest_race_in/dpa0z8j/) is part 4

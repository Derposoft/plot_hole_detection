"WHO AWAKENS THE DJINN OF THE PAST?!" I roared mightily, stretching my arms after my cramped rest. I looked down to see a young man, no older than 25, holding my lamp, and staring up at me. I fold my arms and look down on him. "Are you the Djinn of the past?" "YES." "Why are you yelling?" "I'M NOT. I'M NATURALLY VERY LOUD. DO YOU WISH TO RELIVE THE PAST?" "Yes." "WHAT MOMENTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO RETURN TO?" "My first math test." "TO YOUR FIRST... wait, first math test?" "I thought you were naturally loud." "Why your first math test?" "I want to change it." "Huh?" "It's not permanent, right? Like a dream?" "Depending." "On?" "If you want it to be." "Not this one." "AWAY!!" I waved my arms, summoning my strength and returning him to his childhood memories. "Now, I will observe. When you are satisfied, just say, 'Huzzah!', and we shall return." The world darkened, and when sight came back, I was in the corner of a small third grade room, and he was sitting at a desk. Curious, I sat back and watched. After a moment, a student leaned over and smacked the boy's back. He smiled. The guy leaned over to do it again, and the boy whipped around, grabbing the guys wrist and slamming him to the floor. "EAT SHIT, ROB!", he yelled as he threw his test in his face. "HUZZAH!" I snapped my fingers, and we returned to the present. "THAT WAS IT?" "What?" He was grinning. "YOU JUST WANTED TO TELL SOMEONE TO EAT SHIT?" "Yeah." "INTERESTING. WHAT IS YOUR NEXT DESIRED MEMORY?" "First day of freshman year." "PERMANENT?" "Yes." "AWAY!!" I repeated the motions from before, this time returning him to the first day of his freshman year. He walked up to a guy that looked like Rob. Rob seemed to be bullying a smaller student. He walked up to Rob, grabbed him by the arm, and flipped him. "EAT FUCKING SHIT, ROB! Now!" I snapped my fingers and we returned. "That felt good." "WHO WAS THAT YOUNG MAN?" "My crush's little brother. I had originally just stood up to him, but he knocked my lights out. I figured, saving her brother would have the same effect, but get me some cred with her." "FAIR ENOUGH. WHAT IS YOUR LAST MEMORY?" "July 23rd, 2010. 3:40 PM." "PERMANENT?" "Yes. When I finish my second sentence, send me back here." "AS YOU WISH. AWAY!!!" This time, we were in a darkened theater. He was sitting next to a girl of his age, watching a movie. She was leaning on his shoulder. "Hey, Arya?" "Yeah?" He put a hand on her cheek, and she looked up at him. He took a deep breath, and kissed her. "I love you." I waited, allowing him to see the result. She smiled and laid her head back on his shoulder. "I know. I'm glad you said it. Want to know why?" "Why?" "Because I love you too." I quietly snapped my fingers, and brought us back. He was crying. "She loved me too?" "BOY." "What?" "LOOK AT YOUR FINGER." He looked down, and gasped in surprise, dropping my lamp. "A... a ring...?" "SHE LOVED YOU TOO." He fell to his knees, taking the ring off and staring at it, covering his mouth with his hand. "She... she married me?" "HERE." I tapped his head, and filled it with the memories his actions changed; the end of the date, the subsequent outings, their first time making love, him proposing, their children. Oh, how he cried anew when he saw his children. Their children. "Oh, god... thank you, Djinn, thank you." "My name is Jrantr Al'ahlam. Granter of Dreams." "Jrantr. Thank you." "Now go. Go to your family." He turned and ran, tears of joy running down his cheeks. I returned to the lamp, content that I had saved another's life from their regrets.

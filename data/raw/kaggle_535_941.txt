Startled, I quickly retracted my hand, looking down in shock at the small, worn bag in my hand. Seemingly from far away, a sharp voice. "So what is it? Do you have a ticket or not?" I looked up into the face of an old bus driver, his fingers tapping the steering wheel, examining me with an expression of increasing annoyance. "Oh..um sorry, no. I thought I did but I must've lost it", I mumbled, my mind still firmly occupied with what I had just felt in my bag - and there was no doubt in my mind what it had been. Expecting to find a ticket or the exact change I needed to buy one, my fingers had instead closed around a smooth wooden hilt, brushing the cold steel barrel of a gun. My heart was pounding. A gun. Why would I need a gun? Because, inevitably, need it I would. I had experienced too much with this bag to doubt it for a second. I had never held a loaded gun before, let alone used one, but I knew this was about to change, whether I liked it or not. And I didn't, not one bit. Luckily I had enough money to buy a ticket and did so absentmindedly. I decided to take a seat at the end of the bus, this way I had everyone on it in my line of view. On my way to the back, my eyes darted across every passenger. Was one of them going to be the reason my bag had provided me with what it had? I'm not proud of it, but my eyes immediately fell on the young middle eastern man who sat alone near the middle of the bus. He seemed to be lost in thought stroking his short, black beard, looking at something other than his eyes were. He was wearing a leather jacket, which seemed suspiciously heavy for the mild weather, but perfect for concealing something underneath. I diverted my gaze, trying not to draw to much attention to myself, I walked on and sat down, my hand resting firmly on my bag. In what situation exactly the gun should be of help to me, I didn't know. I only hoped I'd recognize it when it would arise. I still kept an eye on every passenger, most of all on the young man. Time seemed to move slower than usual. Minutes that seemed like hours passed and so far nothing had happened, but I could still feel the outline of the gun pressing against my fingers, so the moment in which I would need it was still yet to come. For a while nothing continued to happen. Then, suddenly, I saw the young man get up - I unzipped my bag. My heart pounding, I watched as he reached one hand into his jacket - my own hand reached into the bag, my fingers closing around the hilt of the gun. And then the man pulled out headphones, put them on and got off the bus, whistling a tune to himself. I realized that I head been on the edge of my seat, I slumped back down breathing out heavily. Then I heard the bus driver shout: "What the fuck?!" I jumped up and ran to the front of the bus, looking out the front window. The driver had assessed the situation fairly adequately. Right there, trotting down the street was a huge elephant. It too seemed slightly confused by the situation, somehow it must've escaped from the local zoo. But slowly it's confusion seemed to be settling and instead, slowly, the shouts from the humans around it seemed to make it angry. Well, it wasn't what I had been expecting but it was hard to think that my bag had been trying to prepare me for a different event. Without hesitation I got off the bus, and pulled out the gun. Meanwhile the elephant had startet to lash out towards groups of people. Steadily the shouting that had been one of surprise and curiosity turned into screams of increasing panic. I didn't want to hurt the elephant, but it seemed much less hesitant to hurt people. I cursed and muttered a "sorry" under my breath, aimed and fired. But instead of bullets the gun fired a dart, which struck the elephant right in it's massive neck. It turned towards me, shaking his trunk, his tusks looking long and dangerous. Normally, this would probably have been a good moment to panic, but the bag had never let me down before. This had been the only dart in the magazine, and it had hit its mark. So I calmly stood there as the elephant started to run towards me. I put the gun back into my bag, and felt it disintegrate beneath my fingers. I looked up just in time to see the elephant stumble, getting slower and slower and, at last, fall over to the side, unconscious. I looked around. There were still a lot of people in the street. Most of them were watching me. Not exactly a situation I liked to be in and I doubted the police would let me keep my magic bag if they found out about it. It was time to go. So once again I reached into my bag and felt my fingers close around car keys. Now I only had to find the damn car they belonged to. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ *Comments and criticism very much appreciated, they help me improve.

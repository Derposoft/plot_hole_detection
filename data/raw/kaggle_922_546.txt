"Come on, Nia. You need to eat a little. Look at how thin you are!" "I've had enough, Glu. I'll throw up if I even have another bite of that steak." Mornings were the worst. Even before I moved in here, I had trouble waking up. But now that I shared a bed with Slo and his comfortable, comfortable cushions, I was a sucker for sleep. Add to that having to eat a meal every morning that would make a King jealous, it was a miracle I got to work on time. As I descended down the stairs, I saw Pree in the living room waiting for me. "Hey, Pree. How do I look?" "As beautiful as ever, darling." "Thank you." "But come here a moment, your lipstick is a bit askew." "Ugh, thanks. It's all because of Slo, I swear. I put everything on in a hurry and shit." "Hey, don't ever bad mouth Slo, girl. It's because of him that you are getting your beauty sleep." She was right about that though. 9 hours of sleep every night does wonders to the skin. "There. Be careful." "I will be. Love you, Pree." Hurriedly, I put my key in the door and turned. Lu was sitting on the steps, turning over the morning paper. "Hey, Lu." "Someone came home late last night." "Late shift at the clinic. It wasn't anything else." "Jesus, Nia. How dumb do you think I am?" "What do you know?" "Enough to tell NV." "Alright, alright. Shush. It was a guy." "Ooooh." "Lu!" "Go on." "It wasn't anything. Just a date." "And?" "And we kissed." "And?" "And we have a second date on Friday." "AND?" "And I am late for work. Jeez." "I want more details when you come back," she called back after me. By the time I got to the car, Rat was already seated in the front. "WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? YOU ARE LATE AGAIN." "I know, I know. I am so sorry." "NIA, THEY ARE GOING TO FIRE YOU IF YOU KEEP THIS UP." "Calm down, Rat. I'll do better." "I FUCKING HOPE SO. NOW SHOW ME THOSE BOYS WHO CATCALLED YOU AROUND THE CORNER." "I can deal with it. You don't have to worry." "I'LL STOP WORRYING AFTER I PUNCH THEIR FACES IN." "Rat, if I hear anything happened to them..." "FINE. BUT IF THEY DO IT AGAIN, THAT'S IT!" I moved the gear from parking and put it on first when I hear a thud. "Hey!" "Reed? Where are you?" "Under the car." He got out from under there and beamed a sly smile at me. "What are you doing?" "I was putting on your new chrome wheels." "Again?" "Well, you keep taking them off." "That's because they look stupid." "Don't you call them stupid, Nia. Take it back." "They are stupid. I work in a hospital, Reed. They don't fit." "Maybe get another car. You want me to look up cars for you, Nia?" "Reed, I am really late. Just get out of the way." "Sure. But I will look up cars for you, Nia. FOR YOU." I had barely composed myself when I heard a voice from the backseat. "I heard you met a guy. How is he better than me?" ----

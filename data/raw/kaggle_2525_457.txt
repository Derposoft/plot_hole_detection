"What do you mean, *they took out the whole fleet?*" General Bak-Naz looked at Captain Jien-Hof with a death glare that could pierce the shields of the Shirn Gri 4. Jien-Hof took a deep breath. "Our fleet of stealth ships were ready for the strike. We triple checked all our signal blockers, scan disrupters, everything." Bak-Naz's stare didn't shift. "Then *how* did they know where you are? Did a chance asteroid hit you? Did one of their ships accidentally ram into you?!?" "No sir, one of their civilian ships seems to had noticed us. We thought they had turned back after having forgotten something, but I believe they notified their military. My ship was the only one to survive the following engagement. All this answer did was anger Bak-Naz even further, their tail curling up, worrying Jein-Hof. The General took a couple deep breaths, seeming to calm down. They then slammed their desk with their spindly arms, screeching. "THE FLEET WAS NOTICED BY A GOD DAMN CIVILIAN SHIP?!? HOW ADVANCED ARE THESE GOD DAMN HAIRLESS SPACE APES?!?" "Something to note sir is that our spies report they never detected us on their scanners." This made the General perk up. "*What?*" The General looked at the Captain at this information. "Then how the hell did they notice us?" Jien-Hof shifted in place, staring down to the right, trying not to look the General in the eyes. "Well... their ships have windows, and none of their scanners went off, so I personally think that they can see Infraorange." Bak-Naz's eyes widened in surprise. "But that's impossible, everyone knows that only the instectoids of Ziclon 5 are the only intelligent species that can see infraorange, and we have a non-aggression pact with her!" "If you need more proof sir, all of our elite infraorange spies have been captured, and only them." The General looked in disbelief. "Do we have any stealth ships in a color other than infraorange?" "No sir, you had all the stealth ships painted infraorange so that her majesty it Ziclon 5 would be at ease." The General debated a thought for a moment. The space monkey sighed before speaking. "We have but one choice then. Ready the Shirn Gri 4, we will attack their outpost at the edge of the Helix Nebula." The human spy painted full red standing in a nearby shadow smiled, not only proving his theory but also finding out where the jungle dwellers are attacking next. __________________________________________________ Alt ending because I wasn't satisfied with the original: The General debated a thought for a moment. The space monkey sighed before speaking. "Put all our ships on defense. Build new stealth ships, painted ultrablue. No way those oversized chimps can see *that* as well."

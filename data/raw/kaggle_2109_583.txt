"Well," Laura coughed up blood, craning her head with all her might, "what does it say?" I stared at the parchment, having just completed reading it myself. "Is it another clue, or are we done?" she continued, wiping a bit of blood from her chin. "No, we're done," I said stoically. "Ah," she sighed, relieved, "and how much fortune are we talking? What does the note say?" *Greetings travelers! Congratulations on getting to the treasure! I hope you're more relieved than disappointed at its contents!...* "It says 'Greetings travelers! Congratulations on getting the treasure! It must have been a difficult journey," I began. "Ah, that's what your mother said, huh? Funny how it comes back to the difficulty of it. But with the money, we'll be able to pay for her treatment. So with our difficulty comes her ease," Laura nodded. I swallowed hard. My throat began to itch as tears threatened to flow down my face. *...You have fought through thick and thin. In the end, you have gained one of the most important and valuable things of all. The wealth of knowledge. And there is nothing comparable to that...* "It continues with, 'Not only will you have an enormous fortune, but also get to enjoy the wealth of knowledge and experiences you got on the way.'" I said, my voice slowly becoming quieter the more I read. "Ha," Laura coughed up more blood, her face pale and in pain, "I'm sure you'll spend a lot of the wealth trying to forget this whole ordeal. This guy really is funny. Though, thinking about it, I'm sure Greg would say the same thing if he was with us today. It's a shame what happened at the--" she coughed another wad of blood up and laid back, signaling with a finger that I should continue. *...And so, dear travelers, I encourage you to take that wealth and continue your life with it. For no matter the amount of wealth you have, I guarantee you that your last memories will be about the ones you love and spend time with. Cherish them, as they are the most important thing in this life.* *Your enigmatic friend,* *The Guide* I looked down at Laura. It seemed she was taking her final breath. It wasn't even worth coming up with a lie when she looked ready to pass. "Well," she whispered hoarsely, "how much is the fortune worth? What did we earn here?" My heart became tight. I didn't know what to say. I wrung the paper in my hand, tearing it a bit as I thought rapidly for something to appease her in her final moments. "It's something that will last me my entire life," I said, sincerely. "That's g--," she didn't open her eyes, only took one final breath to say, "I wish I could spend it with you." With her passing, I stood up and looked at the horizon spanning miles below me. All of the land that we trecked to get here. All of my closest friends were dead. The only solace I could take was that no one was going to be as disappointed as I was to discover that all their sacrifices were in vain. I gripped the parchment tightly and took a few steps forward, looking down more steeply. Keeping to my promise, I held on to the treasure that would last me for the rest of my life and jumped. _____________________________________ For more... seriously depressing stories, come check out /r/Nazer_The_Lazer!

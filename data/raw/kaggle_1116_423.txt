In life, you can gain points, for every 7 points you gained a level, which was shown upon an afterlife scoreboard that was hard to miss. In life certain actions gives you points that will, in the afterlife, give you a level, how the system works seems somewhat random.  But it seems to be based on merits you have gained in life. My Grandmother was a famous model in her youth, and fought for equity for everyone in this nation she was proud to be born in, she died poor, but loved. Having spent all her fortune on trying to solve the problem, the day after she died, every newspaper, both printed and online, every news source how amazing she was in life, she had beaten out several people who changed the nation for the better, and was in the top 10 000, something few managed to do, while for others she was a symbol of equity, to me she was a symbol of stress. "When will you go back to school?", "Are you looking for a job?", "Why do you not have a girlfriend yet, when I was your age I had 2 children!" and so on, while I was sad to see her die, I was also kinda happy. I never did go back to school, I spent my time at home, mining various types of crypto currencies, changing them from on to the other, I was never really rich, but I had a nice computer, I had company on Discords, and i found entertainment in my games, tv-series and such. This made it all the more odd that I died at the ripe age of 108, childless, but content with my life, I did watch the 1000 movies to watch before you die, I did empty my anime backlog, and i did put in at least 10 hours of playtime in every steam game I owned. Dying was weird, and going to the afterlife was weirder, in front of me was my personal scoreboard, you look down | Actions  | Points  | |:-----------|------------:| | Watch Every movie you wanted to see    |     250| | Watch Every anime you wanted to see    |     250| | Watch Every tv-series you wanted to see |  250| | Player Every game in your steam library    |    1000| | Die with no regret    |    150| | Die happy     |    100| | Helping that old lady over the street    |    1| | Beating Dark Souls    |    180| | Dying    |    5| | Reddit Karma    |    18875|

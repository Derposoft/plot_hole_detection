But not quite like this. He remembered everything. It played over and over in that infinite darkness that overtook him: the car, burning; Rachel, screaming; the hot waves of his own blood pouring down his neck. But she had lived. He had gotten her out of that car, used both his hands to squeeze the sputtering wound of her thigh shut until he he heard the wail of ambulances. And then Clint collapsed. He remembered realizing, as he stared at the wet pavement, he would never get up again. But when Clint opened his eyes, he saw his own bedroom ceiling. He reached up, and the gash on the side of his head was gone. He was still wearing his old Arctic Monkeys hoodie, which had been soaked in his and Rachel's blood. "What the hell," Clint muttered. He sat up, stared across his room. And shrieked. A man in a crisp black suit sat at Clint's desk. He held a phone that seemed to be all glass, yet it gleamed brightly in the man's hands. "Oh," he said. "You're awake." Clint stared around in confusion and mounting horror. "Why are you in my house?" he managed. Easiest of the questions he could ask. "Better question is why are *you* in your house?" "Uh. I live here?" "I can't believe you forgot what happened yesterday." The man finally pocketed his phone. "Sorry. Work never rests." Clint clutched at his hoodie. The blood that should have been there. "What's happening?" "You may call me Death." The man spread his thin boney fingers. "You may have heard of me. We met, yesterday. I'm the one who picked you up off the road." "Then how am I alive?" "Oh, you're not." Death smoothed the lapels of his suit and stood to look out the window. "This is a new sort of in between I've devised." He smiled over his shoulder at Clint. "I've been trying these things called *video games*, you see." Clint couldn't help his laugh. All this was too absurd, too insane. "Can you please get out of my house before I call the police?" Death turned to him and scowled. "This is not your home, Clint Whitaker. This is one of the unused levels of hell. And you are part of my new experiment." Shock and disbelief warred in Clint's mind. He shook his head and insisted, "That's insane. That's not possible." "You remember dying yesterday, don't you?" Clint nodded. "Surely resurrection is more unlikely than death." "This isn't what I imagined death would look like." "Oh, no one ever imagines death quite right." The man walked to Clint's bedside and smirked down at him. "But you and I are going to play a little game. We're going to see if you can get to the castle and rescue the princess." He offered his phone to Clint. Clint reached out a shuddering hand and took it. On the screen, he saw a hospital room. And unmistakably in the bed lay Rachel in a sea of tubes and wires. "You kept her alive when you died, true." Death's smile was wicked and delighted. "But you haven't saved her from me yet." "Are you fucking crazy? You'd kill her just as part of some stupid game?" "Yes. I'd also save her as part of some stupid game." Death walked to the door. "It's your choice, of course. But if you do nothing, know she will die." "But what am I supposed to *do?*" "Escape hell. Find where I've hidden her." Death grinned. "Think of yourself like a modern Orpheus in reverse. If you don't keep looking for your girl, she's gone for good. And so are you." Clint scrambled out of bed and yelled at him, "Why the fuck are you doing this to us?" Death smiled again. "It's quite simple. You're interesting, and I'm bored." And then he walked out of the room, shutting the door behind him. When Clint tried to follow, Death was already gone. *** /r/shoringupfragments [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/85bpul/wp_you_die_in_your_girlfriends_arms_after_saving/dvwgk4g/) | [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/85e7ct/9_levels_of_hell_part_3/) | [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/85jvbu/9_levels_of_hell_part_4/) If you want to stay up to date, make sure to follow my sub.

"Explain to me again how it works?" We're in bed. It's warm. Heavy down. The ceiling fan *clap-clap-claps*. Angie rubs my chest. Stares up at the fan. "They...well, I guess they sort of *shoot* electricity into your brain," she says. "Not a lot. A little. Then you have like a seizure. Then it's over." "Sounds awful," I say. "How's it help?" "Kinda resets your brain, I think." She's making that face. Pursed lips. Half-closed eyes. The *Worry Has Turned to Anger* face. "It's probably a scam. Just torture. Just taking my money." "But Dr. Tenneson..." "Yeah. She thinks it'll help." The hand is still on my chest. "Are you mad at me for making you go?" She doesn't answer. She probably is, but doesn't want to say. "You can't make me do anything. I went because I went." "I thought it'd just be talking," I say. "I thought that's what therapy is. Just talking. Maybe some drugs." "It's that," she says, nodding. "And sometimes, when *that* doesn't work, it's things like ECT. Nobody knows." She sighs. "Nobody knows. It's all guessing." "Did talking make you feel better at all?" She gets up off the bed. "Not any better than talking to you." "I'm not a therapist." "You're a good listener." "Well....yeah." "Talking helps. It helps me understand things. But I need a little more than understanding." She finds one of the many framed pictures in the room, picking it up, looking at the image, then setting it back down - face down - on her dresser. All the pictures are like that. Face down. She doesn't like seeing the faces of her friends and family until she wants to see the faces. She doesn't like them watching her. "How many times?" She looks at me. "How many times do I have to shoot electricity into my brain? Dunno. Maybe 10 maybe 50. It causes memory problems. Looking forward to that..." "Oh. But that's not..." "It's like changing the wiring in my brain," she says. "It'll help...it'll just help. Or it won't." "Then it's worth trying." She nods, then moves to the door. "Okay. I gotta go. Mom's taking me. You be good. You're in charge while I'm gone." "I'm always good," I say. "Good luck." She smirks, opens the doors, then leaves. I'm alone. The ceiling fan *clap-clap-claps*. I can't move. I can only wait. I can only watch the ceiling fan. I can only wonder who she'll be when she comes back. If anything will change. I couldn't do anything that day in her first room, the pink and white one, with unicorns and a towering dollhouse in the corner. I could only sit on her pillow, there in the dark, on the day after Christmas, as her uncle crept into the room and whispered things into her ear, things I couldn't hear. Eventually I fell on the floor. Eventually I was knocked under the bed. I think that's why she still talks to me. Why she doesn't mind me looking at her. Because I wasn't looking at her then. Like the framed pictures were. And the posters were. And the dolls were. This is our fourth bedroom. Things change. Things stay the same. I've sat on so many pillows and watched her lose herself. Watched her hurt herself. Watched her wrap braided blankets around her throat and look desperately for some place to hang the other end. All I've ever been able to do is talk to her. Or, I suppose, mostly just listen. Somewhere far, far away, I feel something like a tingle. Like I've come out of the dryer and I'm crackling all over. The feeling lasts less than a minute, but at the end I can no longer hear the ceiling fan. I can no longer see the bedroom door. I'm still here. Still me. But all that is is just a dusty, gray bear. Flattened. Patchy. There's nothing to hear and there's nothing to see. There's nothing to say. I can't say anything at all. Then I remember that really, I never could, could I? Everything is dark. At least I still remember Angie. That's more than enough for an old bear like me.

"Turn it off! Turn it off!" the man cried out. His scraggly beard now dripping with sweat. He looked up at the man torturing him, his own green eyes wide and fearful. The basement's ceiling behind the torturer looked dark and distant and there were a few cracks in it. The victim's blonde hair now damp and stuck to his forehead, hanging down in bunches, his head drooped once again. "I'll leave town. You'll never see me again. Please..." he whispered. "You know. I know. That's not possible." "I already said, I don't know what you're talking about" the victim whimpered. The torturer lifted the cigarette from his lips "Yes you do," he said, looking away and exhaling a cloud of smoke. "There's no way around this, you got yourself in, now you pay the price. Now shut up, it'll be less painful. And if you could, close your eyes, we don't want 'em popping out." The victim silently did as advised, sitting strapped to an old wooden chair. To the side, a microwave-oven lay disassembled, the oven's transformer wired-up to the victim's two legs so as to cause pain but not electrocution. **Power on** The victim's jaws clenched as his whole body jerked in the chair. A loud hum, accompanied by incoherent mumbling filled the basement. The victim's body sizzled a little. After 30 seconds, the torturer pulled the plug. **Power off** "Kill me!" The victim yelled, his voice now hoarse and uneven. "Is that what she said..." the torturer whispered. "Who?" The victim said uneasily "Is.  that.  What.  She.  Said." The torturer said even quieter. "Is it!" He said, this time yelling. "My wife! Is that what she said when you finished raping her?" He screamed, tears coming to his eyes. "I.. I don't know who..." the victim said, looking away... **Power on** 2,000 volts surged through the victim's legs as they resumed cooking, the smell of burning flesh filling the room. "UrrraaaAH!" He shrieked, clenching the arms of the chair. His whole body convulsed and the old wooded chair began creaking. **Power off** "Now answer me!" The torturer demanded. The victim stared into the torturer's eyes "I'm so sorry..." "And there it is." The torturer said in an monotone. "Now I suppose I should forgive you? Let you off scott-free?" "I didn't mean to kill her." The torturer said nothing. He just stared at the victim silently. After a pause, the torturer's face began to go blank. He stepped closer to the victim and began placing duct tape over his lips. "No. No no. Please! I'll plead guilty! Charge me, I'll plead guilty!" The victim shrieked as he tried squirming away. Slowly and calmly, the torturer moved the wires of the transformer to the victim's chest and back... on both sides of his heart. "Mmmhhm!" The victim got out, his mouth covered, as he saw with wide eyes the electrodes moved to his heart. **Power on** *JOLT* **Power off** The victim's head finally hung where he sat, lifeless. *"How to destroy a body"* the torturer Googled on his phone. "Daddy?" The voice of a little-girl sounded from upstairs. "Where's the microwave? I'm *starving!*" "It broke, honey. Daddy had to throw it out. Now be a good girl and finish setting the table."

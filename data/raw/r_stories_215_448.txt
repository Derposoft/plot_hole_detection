My cats “found” a lost racing pigeon by t2_3ts4eox0

I live in the midlands UK 🇬🇧 . For context it was Summer

I have 3 cats. For all intensive purposes I’ll call them Shy, Evil, and Curious

We came home one day to find Shy meowing at the door extremely anxious and skitty. This is very unusual and because Shy has only one eye and has had a traumatic past which means that we thought he was being bullied by other cats in the neighbourhood and this was unacceptable because it had never happened before.

I ventured to the back garden expecting to see an ominous cat on the fence hissing aggressively at my garden. But I was shocked to find Evil and Curios with an injured bird. Evil was “playing” with (torturing) it and Curious was just watching from afar. I instantly scared my cats away from the bird because Evil only usually does this to moths and mice. Only rarely a bird and they always manage to escape. But this pigeon was clearly injured and we thought it was dead (it was just playing dead)

After assessing the situation we touched the bird and we could tell it was definitely alive. Our only option was to keep it away from the cats be ya dog could not fly and would continue to be attacked by Evil if it were left alone. We put it in a cat box.

I’m not sure what happened here I don’t remember. I think we must have fed it? And or somehow helped nurture it?i don’t recall fully

Anyways there was a tag on the pigeons leg it was a capsule we disconnected opened and read. It stated this this bird was a racing pigeon and we gathered that it had most likely been blown off course by the storm and lightning that had been over us earlier that day. I suspected that it had been blown of course and disoriented by the tropical storm. (because birds keep direction by ions and stuff that Tropical storms are full of. very gross oversimplification but you can get the idea).

We called the number on the letter the receiver only picked up the phone after many hours and he told us all about the pigeon and how our theories were mostly correct. It was taken to the owner who lived only an hour away who offered us £100 for our time but we rejected the offer. (I would have taken it but I didn’t deliver the pigeon.

Thx for reading all the way to the end I just wanted to share my mildly interesting story to the 1, 2 heck maybe even 10 people that would have read this to the end.

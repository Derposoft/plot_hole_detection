**DM:** Okay, so, you set up camp for the night. **Julie:** I want to explore the area first. Something doesn't seem right. **John:** Yeah, I kinda want to look around, too. **DM:** Roll me an investigation check! **Julie:** Crap. Eight. **John:** Ha! Nat 20! **DM:** Okay, so, you check out the surrounding area and you suddenly hear a rustling in a nearby bush. **John:** Can I pee on the bush? **Brett:** Please don't do that. There might be berries or something on it we can eat. **DM:** There are not any berries. *But* you look around the bushes and you find a band of pixies. **John:** The *fuck?!* **Julie:** I wanna talk to them. **Dana:** Yeah, they might know where to find this cavern we're searching for since *SOMEONE* used our map as toilet paper! **Matt:** What? I had the shits, okay? **Dana:** Yeah, from drinking all that Orc mead! **Matt:** Still better than this shitty beer. [*crushes can and reaches for another Natty Ice*] **Julie:** I'm talking to the pixies. What languages do they know? **DM:** They know the common tongue. **Julie:** Okay, so hey there, little pixies? What's up? **DM:** [*in high-pitched voice*] Hi! Sorry, we hope we didn't disturb you! We're just hanging out, that's all. Don't let us bother you. **Matt:** They're hiding something. I can smell it. **John:** All I can smell is that nasty beer you're drinking. **Matt:** Shut up. I wanna interrogate these pixies. [*rolls*] Boom! Eighteen, motherfucker. **DM:** [*sighs*] All right, so Sloppy the Dwarf, you go up to the pixies and you start to interrogate them. As you do, you notice one of them is wearing armour just like yours. He's got a tiny axe and he's even drinking really shitty beer like yours. **Matt:** Hey. Eat a dick. **John:** I think he already did. His breath smells like balls. **DM:** And how would you know what balls smell like? **John:** Well, after we made out last week... **Julie:** Okay, enough! I'm gonna ask the pixies if they wanna join us around the fire, maybe share some of the fish we caught. **DM:** [*in high-pitched voice*] Omigod, we'd LOVE TO! We're your biggest fans! **Dana:** Wait, wait, hold up. Fans? What? **DM:** You heard...erm, Fingelsnark. Yeah. He said he's your biggest fan and you see that his girlfriend, Tinytits, is scribbling away furiously on a piece of parchment. In fact, several of them are carrying pieces of parchment or notebooks, plus ink and quills. A few of them are wearing armour and carrying weapons that are tiny versions of yours. **John:** Hey, erm, whatcha...whatcha writing there, little fella? **DM:** [*higher-pitched voice*] Fuck you, I'm a girl! **John:** Fuck you, I'm a non-binary demisexual elf fighter. **DM:** [*same higher-pitched voice*] Not according to my headcanon, you're not! **Brett:** What? Are they writing fan-fiction about us? **DM:** [*normal voice*] Ask the pixies. **Brett:** Are you writing fan-fiction about us? **DM:** [*higher-pitched voice*] Erm...no... **Matt:** I'm stealing one of their books and reading it. **DM:** [*normal voice*] You snatch away a tiny book that Crinkleballs is writing in and you begin to read it. **Matt:** I'm sorry, what? What's his name? **DM:** You try coming up with all these names! You weren't even supposed to know they were following you until you got to the cavern. Anyway, you open the book and you start to read it aloud. They have been following you for months and every night they *have been writing fan-fiction* about *ALL. OF. YOU.* And apparently they've decided that Sloppy the Dwarf and Twoflower the Elf are OTP. **Brett:** Oh my god. No. NO! **Julie and Dana:** BWAHAHAHAHA! **Matt:** Well, shit. [*looks at John*] Yeah, okay, I'd totally do him. **John:** [*shrugs in Gay*] I'm down. Let's make fan-fact. **Dana:** Okay, no, not in front of us! **John:** Then y'all go back to camp and me and Sloppy will perform for the pixies. [*touches Matt's cheek lovingly*] Whaddya say? Sloppy firsts? **Matt:** [*laughs*] Yeah, all right. Should we roll a stamina check or acrobatics? **DM:** You know what? Do both. I kinda want to see what happens. **Julie:** I'm going to bed. Correction, Moon's going to bed. **Brett:** I get out my camcorder so I can sell the video on DnDporn.com. **John:** I make one of the pixies transcribe it so we can put it on r/SuddenlyGay later. **DM:** God damn it, Matt! You're not even gay! **Matt:** Hey! Sloppy can do whatever he wants. And right now he's doing Twoflower. **John:** We are now bromosexuals. **Brett:** And they say bromance is dead...

You are never going back from this. You can see most of your reflection in the mirror of the hall, even from the middle of the living room where you sank. You see a woman in her early forties, you see her clothes and her face, but you can barely recognize her. Your eyes wander to the left to find your wedding picture, framed on the wall. Now, you see yourself. 21, radiant and gloriously happy. The mirror calls your attention again. Something is so wrong about that reflection; but it feels better when you focus on the kid you are holding in your arms. You can see yourself in her dark curls, and in her clean skin. You kiss her forehead. She stopped crying, now. She felt so guilty, so responsible of her own actions. And all she did was to break something. Something she shouldn't have. And she's only 7, innocence incarnated. Now, tired with all her desperate tears, she fell asleep in your arms. The mirror gives you the peaceful image of a mother and a daughter. But you know that everything changed, because of her. After 20 years of marriage, and two beautiful kids, and so many memories, today the spell is broken. All it took was to stop for a minute from your chores, and look at your daughter, and her distraught little face, and ask her a simple question. *What is wrong, pumpkin?*, and how many times must have you asked her those exact words? She looked at you, her dark eyes wide open and huge. "I'm scared of Dad" she said. And in that moment, the spell was broken. Your tears upset her, she ran to hug you when you fell on the ground, and you held her while she hugged you and your crying and her own became a single thing. Because you realised it was true. You, too, were scared of him. And you had always known, and always swept it aside. *But he loves you*. You had been scared to leave him. You had been scared to contradict him. You had been scared of his silent, furious vengeance. And you are never coming back from this: because after 20 years, you finally understood; if you can't give yourself a better past, at least you will fight with all you have to give your daughters a better future. The spell is broken.

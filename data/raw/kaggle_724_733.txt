The translator on Jack's wrist beeped, flashing in bold letters what the alien had just said to him. "You mean to tell me you came here, a hundred and thirty light years away from your home, across the vast expanse of deep space, in *that*?" The alien pointed a blue tentacle at Jack's starship. "Yeah! What's wrong with it? Top-of-the-line engineering, only had to spend a couple years on board fixing some leaks--" "*LEAKS*? You used a highly pressurized vessel traveling beyond the speed of light with *holes in it* to get here?" "Well, yeah, but it's all I could afford--" "Is your species *dying*? Do you come to request aid? We'd be more than happy to assist!" Jack chuckled and smiled. "No, not particularly, I just wanted to explore some of the spiral arm before getting married back home." "WE HAVE NEVER EVEN *CONSIDERED* LEAVING OUR STAR SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE INSURMOUNTABLE RISKS INVOLVED WITH DEEP SPACE TRAVEL AT RELATIVISTIC SPEEDS, AND YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU PERSONALLY *BOUGHT* A SHIP *WITH HOLES* AND DROVE IT BEYOND THE SPEED OF LIGHT, JUST BECAUSE YOU *WANTED TO*?" "Yep, pretty much." The color drained from the alien's face, but it was still completely obvious that it really wanted to learn more about 'Ordinary Human Jack'. "What does your species do for science now?" "Well, it's been a couple years since I've heard anything exciting, but somebody *did* just figure out how to tether a warp field to cables before I left; really helps with FTL tug-ships and what not." The alien was intrigued by this scientific development. "Oh, and we dunked some astronauts into the event horizon of a black hole using it. They're still recovering from mild radiation poisoning, but hey, they said it looks pretty cool down there. Somebody petitioned to send an artificially intelligent drone down there, too; its impressionist paintings are selling for millions of dollars all across the United Systems--" The color drained from the alien's face yet again. "Okay, so you built an infinitely strong tether for dragging ships home in FTL, but decided to use it instead to explore black holes? WAIT A MINUTE, DID YOU SAY YOU SENT *PEOPLE* DOWN THERE *FIRST*???" "Well, the civilian ship that wanted to try it didn't have any drones on board, so--" "CIVILIANS?? NOT A SCIENTIFIC OR GOVERNMENT AGENCY?? SOME NORMAL PEOPLE JUST DECIDED TO TIE SOME COOL ROPES AROUND THEMSELVES AND BUNGEE-JUMP INTO A *GRAVITATIONAL WHIRLPOOL OF DOOM*?" "Again, yep, pretty much. We even have the video on board if you'd like to see it; the thing went totally viral on YouTube--" "NONONONO, JACK, WE'VE SEEN QUITE ENOUGH." "Aw, wait, what about the one where a replica Star Destroyer punched a hole through a red dwarf?" The alien stared at Jack in disbelief. "Wait... THAT WAS *YOU*???" They talked like this all day and night, with Ordinary Human Jack talking about the incredible exploits of his kind, and a growing number of interested Balthalorians listening in. Upon his return to Earth, the Balthalorian delegation earned a place at the United Systems Senate, among seven other alien races discovered by Jack that year. Each had sophisticated technologies in certain fields, sometimes centuries beyond human analogs. However, not a single civilization had been even *remotely* close to developing interstellar travel, citing incredible risks involved. Jack was promoted to the highest reaches of a newfound Human diplomatic corps, and became jokingly known across the spiral arm as the "Accidental Diplomat" for his calm, casual and eager conversations with newly discovered alien life, eloquently introducing them to the ways of humanity, despite being an explorer by trade. It is thought that his charming kindness and understanding of advanced technology single-handedly brought dozens of alien races into cooperation with the human fold, largely out of admiration of our tenacity and stubbornness in the face of, well, *physics*. And Jack is still revered across the conjoined realms to this day. The Tangarok call him "Uplifter". The Kandaj call him "Kindlord". The Qekh call him "Voidmaster". Alas, as nice as these names seem, none of them are really and truly representative of Jack, the Accidental Diplomat. A hero he may be, but to those Balthalorians who knew him best, he was simply another "Ordinary Human", out to explore the cosmos by whatever means necessary, no matter how stupid or stubborn those means tended to be.

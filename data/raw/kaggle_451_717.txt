I slipped into the corporeal world once again, and found that I was standing in my old body. Hunched over for millennium after millennium, it was still standing right where I parked it. The mind uploading terminal had long since eroded away, and the world looked pretty untamed. *Where am I again?* I turned my head too swiftly, creating a sharp pain in my neck. I raised my hand to massage it, only to feel it start to burn as well. I already felt the limitations of my outdated brain. My other form had been so much more precise. I drifted through the Atherium, harnessing all the brain power I had cared to muster, and now I was locked in this meat suit. I didn't even remember what OS I was running. "Jesus Christ." I muttered. "Remind me not to do this again." I said to no one. The world around me had overgrown, and I stood in a small clearing in a forest with trees at least 200 meters in height. Green and blue vines wound down their monstrous, bulbous trunks, and large leaves spurted out at random. The wind rustled with reckless abandon through all the foliage - it sounded like the pattering of a crowd of small children, running around excitedly on Christmas day. I risked a leg movement. Less pain. *Might as well rip the bandaid off.* I began to walk. "Ow. Ow. Ow." I said with each step. Eventually my pain reached sub-audible levels, and I walked in silence. I wasn't sure where I was going, but the thought of not moving was somehow worse than the pain. I looked up through the canopy of the trees, and watched the shifting lights through the leaves. Lighting suggested multiple suns, on opposite sides of the sky for now. I changed directions. The level forest greeted my eyes from every direction. I kept walking. My lab coat got caught on a stray branch. A pair of small pincers clamped down with all their might. I stopped. "Hey, buddy, do you mind?" I asked. *Oh sorry* the tree responded, releasing me. *Natural reflexes and all.* "I know that game." I said. *What?* "It's an phrase." *...* "Never mind." I said, turning away. *Don't get many visitors here.* the tree interjected. I paused, then turned back. "What is this place, anyway?" I inquired. *Keltonia.* "Never heard of it." *Not many have. It used to carry a different name.* "Most things do." *Arcadia.* "Neat." I replied. *Well, you don't have to be a dick.* the tree responded, hurt. "Look, I don't mean to be rude, but unless you have some Nytrocyanide, I'm not really interested." *...* "Oh my god, do you?" I asked, my heartbeat quickening. *I naturally produce it. We all do.* "Can I have some?" *I don't know...* said the tree haltingly. *You were kind of a dick to me.* "The past is the past, I always say. Why are you being selfish, if you produce it naturally..." *I don't produce enough for both of us* the tree said defensively. *Besides, I've probably been alive for way longer than you. I'm a goddamn tree.* "Not possible." I replied. "What do you mean 'not possible'?" I hesitated. "I'm an alpha." *Bullshit.* "I swear. I remember when trees weren't telepathic and everything." *Nope. I don't believe you.* "Well excuse me for not caring what one tree in the entire Keltonian forest thinks, but have to see a man about a horse." I said, turning away nonchalantly. *What?* "Another phrase, don't worry about it." I mutter backwards. I reach a safe distance. "Get some of this motherfucke-" I shout, turning back around, raising the plasma gun from one of my pockets. The tree was quicker. A monstrous root leaped from the ground and wrapped around my feet. Another nocked my gun away. *Did you think I'd fall for that?* "Kind of." I said, now hanging from the air. *Well now you can't hurt anyone.* "What are you gonna do, hold me like this forever? I don't decay, guy. I'll be here until you stop holding me." *Then I'll just never stop holding you.* "..." *...* "..." *Hello?* But I was in the Aether once again, flowing through time much more comfortably. *Maybe next year.* I think. ___ /r/Periapoapsis

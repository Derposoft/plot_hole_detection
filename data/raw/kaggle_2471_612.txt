"Michael? Are you there?" She listened for a moment to the air on the other end. This was the part she dreaded the most. Her biggest regret finally living up to its end of the bargain. But to her relief, the intercom crackled in response. "Emma? Hello?" "Hi." She answered, unsure of what to say next. "Em? You still there?" "Yes. How... How are you today? I miss you. Is everything alright. Up there?" She waited for a response again. Such an awkward question to ask, especially these days. But it was one of the few things familiar to her from their previous life. "Oh." Michael paused. "I miss you too. Things are okay up here. Sort of?" "...You mean it's safe??" "No, not like that. Not even close. A couple of people broke in last night. Looking for food, water... Drugs and medicine. This guy had a bad leg... No wonder he used the door-" "Is someone hurt?" "Not anymore. Um, I, uhh... I was dragging him to the yard. I had to clean up the kitchen. They broke the windows." "Are you okay?" "I won. I got cut though." "How bad?" "Not bad. But there's a few of them." "But people are still alive?" More silence, followed by odd noises across the connection. "Hi. Emmie? One of 'em woke up. I'll call you back." About ten minutes passed and it pained her to think about what happened. Again the signal came back. "I'm back." He answered. "I think we're good now. The big one, I thought he was dead. But he was dedicated... So how are the kids?" "Good. They miss you." "Tell them I said hi." "How's the dog?" "Gummi's fine. She's been ok. She's right here. Go ahead, say something." "*bark*" "Have you been eating?" "We got a deer maybe... Two, three days ago. There's always squirrels if it doesn't work out. Are you okay down there? With food, I mean?" "Yeah, they've been giving out rations. It's not perfect but, you know." "As long as you're all okay. Then I'm okay. Understand?" "...." "Em?" "I'm sorry we left you." She choked. "I know you tried, and I saw you coming when the door was closing-" "Hey, hey.... look. I got stuck at the store. And it's not like traffic was very good. It's okay. You did the right thing." "Is there, radiation or anything?" "No. At least I don't think so. I'm sure we'd be dead by now." "The neighbors, are they-" "Dead. Oh yeah. They're dead." "Robbers?" "No. No... The, um, the Harrisons? I think they overdosed or something. Still in bed." "Oh." "Yeah, and the Munsons... Well, I don't know what happened there. I found Earl on the front lawn. Not a mark on him. I couldn't find Kathie- I mean I found her body. But her head was gone." "What's happening to people?" "Wish I could tell you. Listen, there's a truck at the gas station." "What about your truck?" "Oh, hit a tree last week. It's done. So, I found one at Barb's old place. I think tomorrow, I'm going to try and get it running. Hey, can the kids come on? I'd like to say hi." "They're playing right now. I don't want them to-" "Cry. Yeah. That's fine. Tell you what, I'm going to rest for a while. Get all this cleaned up." "...I love you Mike." "Love you too. Let me know if you need help." That was his classic goodbye. They both knew he couldn't make good on it ever again. But that was alright. --- EDIT: Part 2 in the comments!

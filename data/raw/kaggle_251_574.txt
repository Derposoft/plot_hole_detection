Is that you? On a Saturday night, checking your phone and Facebook feeds over and over, waiting for that special someone to reply? Laughing it off as your friends ask you whether you have a date, when in reality your heart has fragmented into a million shards? Waking from yet another surreal dream where you *almost* had it all? If that is you, then you are likely MISSING one or more of the Four Key Qualities to Getting It On. If it has worked for millions of others, why not you? **RESPECT** - If you don't Respect them, don't expect them to ever welcome you into their lives. And this cannot just be lip service, either! Respect is genuine only when you have truly found something in them that you admire! So go on out, dig through their Internet profiles, speak to all their friends, reach out to their family for more information! Bonus points if this is all done in secret! Once you have found that special something, be it a drawing they did in 3rd grade, or a good test score last summer, make sure you know you appreciate it! Print it on a banner! Turn it into a song! Spray paint it on their pet so they don't miss it! Make sure they know you know their hidden achievements, and glorify them the best you can! **ATTITUDE** - History is full of people who have given up, don't be one of them! Ever wonder what the key difference between slasher movies and teen romances is? You've got that right! It's whether the object of affection has a change of heart at the end! That's the milestone which immediately elevates the stalker to the Special Someone! So don't take 'no' for an answer, find ways to hear it as a 'yes'! Remember, if they don't want to ever see you again in their lives, it is only because you haven't convinced them that they are wrong! **PERSUASIVENESS** - Find the Extra Special Way of reaching out to your Extra Special Someone! Only fools believe that one size fits all! What worked for someone else, may not work for you! They don't like the flowers you bought, or the chocolates you acquired? Don't humiliate yourself by barking up the wrong tree more than once, put that noggin of yours to work! That's right! If they are easily intimidated, work on cowing them with friendly joke threats! Concerned about their social standing? Show them that you can easily embarrass them in public unless they say yes to your date! Headstrong, independent, self-assured? Why, there are chemical solutions an easy purchase away! **EMPATHY** - Understanding your Special Someone is the glue which will ensure your relationship stays tight and healthy for years to come! Focus on building a pattern of expectations for them, so that they are lulled into an inescapable familiarity! When they are upset, recognise it, and promise to help them get happier! When they then improve, recognise it too, for that is when you can reinsert yourself into their lives! Remember, if you don't Empathise with them, you will never know how best to present yourself, make yourself special to them too! All the best, boys and girls! --- NOTE: I DO NOT ENDORSE THIS POST. IT HAS MADE ME FEEL A HUNDRED TIMES DIRTIER THAN WHEN I BEGAN THIS AS A JOKE POST. I SWEAR I AM NORMAL IN REAL LIFE.

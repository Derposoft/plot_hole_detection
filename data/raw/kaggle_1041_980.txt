Breathe in. I remember there wasn't much pain, not like you'd expect. The adrenaline dulled it, made it seem far away. My breathing shallowed, my head got light, my vision dimmed. I was still alive, and she found me where the truck had thrown me. She was holding me, calling for help. I remember shoving her out of the way just before the truck hit me; I must have pushed her far enough, because she wasn't hurt. I remember dying. Breathe out. I have a hard time putting into words how happy I was in that moment. Laying there under the covers, warm and comfortable, unharmed, alive. Or at least something analogous to alive. Equal to alive. Undead? Who cared. I was an atheist. I believed there was no afterlife, no gods, nothing waiting for me after my death. And I had a good life, so I wanted to keep it as long as possible. Maybe forever, if given the chance. **WERE YOU ONE OF THE ANNOYING ONES?** What? **THE ANNOYING ONES. ATHEISTS. THE HOLIER-THAN-THOU ONES, MINUS THE HOLY BIT.** I used to be, I think. But I grew out of it after a while. **LOOK UP, YOUNG ONE. LOOK UPON ME.** I sit up and look around my bedroom. It's exactly as it was yesterday, not a single detail out of place. I don't have an eidetic memory, but it looks real. Feels real. And there, standing by the door, is Death. I can tell immediately by looking at him, there's no way this entity could be anything but Death, the OG Classic Death too. He's tall, over six feet, and made up of nothing but bone. Terribly old, sunbleached white bone. There's a sense of cleanliness to him, immaculate perfection, no dirt or rot on those bones. He's almost like a statue of porcelain, wrapped about with a black robe that hangs loosely on him. The robe does nothing to hide how thin he is; I can see the shapes of his shoulder bones and pelvis through the thin cloth. And in his right hand, a scythe. Black the handle, gleaming silver the blade, long and thin with delicate engravings that might be ancient language, or perhaps purely decorative without meaning. Again the indication of unfathomed age but no wear; the tool's edge was pristinely sharp. **I CAN HEAR YOU. STOP FAWNING OVER ME; IT'S UNSETTLING.** I almost laughed. The thought of Death finding anything unsettling just seemed- **STOP THAT. FOCUS ON ME. I HAVE COME TO ENLIST YOUR HELP WITH A VERY SPECIFIC PROJECT.** ...Project? What's going on? Why am I still alive? Am I, really? **YOU DIED. NOW YOU LIVE. I DIDN'T RESURRECT YOU; DIDN'T BRING YOU BACK. YOU'RE HERE NOW BECAUSE I SUBVERTED THE PROCESS BY WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE GONE ANYWHERE.** Why? I mean, thank you, but why? **OKAY, HEAR ME OUT.** Hesitance. Nervousness. Uncertainty. **I'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS VIDEO GAME AND I WANT TO TRY SOMETHING.** In Death's left hand was a physical copy of Dark Souls. Okay, come on, you can't really expect me to not have an internal monologue about how ridiculous this is. You're Death. You can't just play video games. **TWO HUMAN BEINGS DIE EVERY SECOND. I APPEAR BEFORE THEM ALL AND TAKE THEM TO THE NEXT LIFE. FROM THIS YOU CONCLUDE THAT I AM OMNIPRESENT, I EXIST IN ALL PLACES AT ONCE, AND THE NUMBER OF TASKS I CAN PERFORM SIMULTANEOUSLY HAS NO LIMIT. YES, I PLAY VIDEO GAMES. I DO MANY OTHER THINGS AS WELL.** ... **SO YOU UNDERSTAND. GOOD. I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME AND HAVE CLOCKED SEVERAL THOUSAND HOURS ON IT ALONE. I HAVE HAD AN EPIPHANY. THE SYSTEM OF DEATH AND AFTERLIFE WHICH I CURRENTLY ADMINISTRATE IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND LEAVES ROOM FOR VAST IMPROVEMENT.** So, what? You'll just stop killing people? **I DO NOT KILL PEOPLE. I AM DEATH. PEOPLE DIE, AND THAT IS WHAT I AM. IT IS BEYOND ME TO AVERT THIS PROCESS, TO DO SO WOULD BE TO DESTROY MYSELF, BUT I CAN CHANGE IT. CHANGE THE RESULT. CHANGE MYSELF.** A respawn mechanic as opposed to permadeath. **YES.** The implications are... huge. Mind-boggling. A total change to civilization. If no one ever stays dead... we'd need to reallocate populations, spread them out more evenly, and limit how many children people could have. Murder wouldn't be one of the most serious crimes. What about food? People could still starve to death, but they'd come back. We'd have to do something about world hunger, but the pressure of time would be so much lighter. Diseases and nukes wouldn't be anywhere near as scary... this would be... this would be... **MORE CONDUCIVE TO PLAYER ENJOYMENT. HARDCORE MODE ONLY APPEALS TO A SPECIFIC MINORITY OF PLAYERS. THE OTHERS LOSE ALL PROGRESS AND ARE FORCED INTO A SECOND RUN WHICH THEY TEND NOT TO FULLY ENJOY, DESPITE ITS AMENITIES.** You're talking about the afterlife. Holy shit, you're saying the afterlife sucks. **THE AFTERLIFE DOES NOT SUCK. BUT THE LOSS OF ONE'S PROPER FIRST LIFE UPSETS AND SADDENS MANY PEOPLE UPON THEIR ARRIVAL. A RESPAWN SYSTEM WOULD ABSOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY ALLOWING PLAYERS TO REAP THE FULL BENEFITS AND PLEASURE OUT OF THEIR FIRST LIVES... AND ONLY THEN PROCEED TO NEW GAME PLUS.** Death gestured to me with his scythe. It wasn't a threat, but it was still hard not to be terrified of him, especially since he'd made clear he didn't enjoy the internal monologue I was currently interrupting him with- **YOU ARE THE FIRST. WE HAVE MANY ISSUES TO SOLVE BEFORE THIS UPDATE GOES LIVE. THE GAME BALANCE MUST BE PRESERVED, DEATH MUST STILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES. GLITCHES MUST BE PATCHED. LEGACY ACCOUNTS MUST BE AFFORDED ACCESS TO NEW CONTENT.** Holy shit. Holy shit. **NATURALLY WE WILL RESOLVE THIS, AS IS TRADITION, WITH CLOSED ALPHA AND BETA TESTS. GET UP. WE HAVE WORK TO DO.**

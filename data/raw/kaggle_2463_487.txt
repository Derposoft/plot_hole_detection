"That frog looking alien. They have a small planet. Only 15,000,000 nukes. The guy with four glossy eyes. An intelligent species. 25,000,000 nukes. The large bulky ones. The ones that attacked us. 40,000,000 nukes. No. 50,000,000" Then he stares at me with his cold calculating eyes. I turn away. What is this human thinking. What even are "Nukes". I reach for my translator and type out the letters. N... U... K... E... What is this? That's not possible. There's no way a jump start species already has the ability to split atoms. Let alone harness them as weaponry. "That guy. Hes looking away from me." The Human Commander turns and whispers at the man besides him. "What is that long neck's deal?" "It seems that the alien is an 'Agnell' and are able to read mines sir." The commander turns back at me. "You reading me right now?" He knows I'm listening. "I don't appreciate you intruding on my mind." "Your species would only require 35,000,000 nukes. You know what nukes are?" I lightly nod. A human gesture of understanding and affirmation. "We want no harm for this council. We only want to be able to protect ourselves. But heed my warning. If you or anyone in this room threatens my civilization. We have more than enough weaponry to wipe your planets clean." his head wanders. Incomprehensible. Unreadable. Then he stops on one thought. "1.5 billion is more than enough to end you all." He smirks I scream. Its not possible. What he needs to execute a mass genocide wouldn't even make a dent in that number. I need to tell the council about the human's power. We need to make peace quickly, before the . "I think I figured out a way to shut you up." He closes his eyes and exhales. Suddenly. A rush of emotions. First, he hits me with all the hope of his planet. All the joy created through their culture. It was amazing. the joys of dinner and family. The celebrations and life, until he hit me with sorrow. His planet's wars. The people he lost. The people his allies lost. A never ending chain of dead souls. How does he remember all of them. All their faces and voices. The blood. The war. He has a moment of doubt in himself, but then anger. The wrath of the human species. The 'Anets' accidental attack on the humans. The humans never let go of that incident. None of them did. Hes groups all aliens based on that first impression. He hates us all. His mind flashes with the images of his son in a casket. A funeral. I feel myself slipping. I can't handle all of this. Its too much. The hatred, the hope, the fear, the determination. All of it directed towards me. I can't. "You better not intrude on my mind the next time we meet." I black out.

######[](#dropcap) I ride the crest of the Probability Wave. The boundary between real and not yet real is blurred. I know, for instance, that I was married. I *remember* that, not as one in a trillion visions glimpsed in the rolling fog of probability, but as concrete, collapsed fact. I married my wife, and we loved each other. I know also that I became ill. I *remember* it because it *happened.* I remember the synchopy of the doctor's terrible phone call. I remember the nights of fear waiting for answers and the terror of receiving all the wrong ones. My mind is tethered to memories of my body weakening, painkillers coursing through my blood, filling the veins of my thin arms and legs with meager relief. The last thing I *know* happened is her face above mine, her voice warm in my ear, her tremulous breath tickling my skin, like the fluttering beat of a hummingbird's heart. From there, the surf takes me and I stand on the board to watch. I am in the hospital, miraculously healthful. A new treatment and my strength returns, the disease in my lungs disappears. I am in the hospital, dying. My body rejects the vaccine and the errant cells in my lungs continue to suck the life from me. I am released after two weeks of observation. My weight is back, my hair is beginning to grow, a black peach fuzz she likes to rub her cheek against. I have an appetite and we get apple fritters. I am heavily medicated, a shell of my self. I cannot raise my body from the hospital bed. My wife turns me over on my side so I can pee, and every millimeter hurts. Months have passed, I am home, my muscles lithe again. We spend all our time together, grateful in the extreme. I am seeing double. Life is back on track and we try for a child. He is born and he takes my grandfather's name. I linger in a half life, my vision singular again, featherlight in the bed, never warm anymore, though the blankets are piled high. I am moved from oncology, the place where the "battle" is fought, to the palliative ward, where the defeated warriors wait for their chance at Valhalla. The farther away my other self gets in time, the more the Wave reveals itself to me. I begin seeing in fours and eights. The further away I get, the more possibilities are revealed. I watch my child's birth in simulcast. He speaks sixteen different first words. His first step happens in thirty two different places. By his third birthday I am watching so many versions of my life with him that they all blur together. But the other side of the coin remains singular and clear. I am in a soft bed. My wife is crying. I can feel her tears falling delicately on my cheeks, but I cannot reach up to touch them. My body is broken. As my mind spirals further and further afield, at last I understand. Like a firework shot into the night sky, my consciousness has exploded forward in its dying moment and afforded me a fleeting glimpse of the Wave. But like those blazing fireballs, whose barest sparks reach the highest heights before blinking out of existence, so too did my mind's most insubstantial final energies reach out farthest through the vector of time. There, innumerable trillions of probabilities blended together, as all of the colors blend together into white. In a hospital bed, in the realm of the realized, where the Probability Wave collapsed, my wife whispers love in my ear and I am gone. ****** #### For More Legends From The Multiverse ## r/LFTM ******* #### Thank you all for the incredible response - many of your comments were very affecting and it's gratifying to see so many people responding so strongly.

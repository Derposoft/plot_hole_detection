*In other news, it appears as if the senior citizen virus - dubbed Serca by the CDC - has begun to take its toll on the economy; with a 12 percent decrease in the active labor force, almost half of the Senate out of commission, and increased pressure on healthcare, the USA could be heading towards a complete colla-* I flick the TV off, chewing the inside of my lip. Bad habit. The fearmongering in the news has already started, it seems. Two years ago, Serca hadn't been much to fear - if anything, the internet had done its best to ensure that the disease was just a joke, *a meme*. News outlets had laughed before offering commiserations, and some of the afflicted elderly had even been put into 'zoos' of sorts to make some kind of fucked up recreational centers where people could still interact with their loved ones, even as their brains withered into dust. Of course, like with a lot of things in life, that fell through rather quickly. Although it was common knowledge that the elderly tended to lack the teeth required for transmission, it quickly became apparent that most forms of intimate interaction worked just as well; saliva, nails drawing blood, what have you. And, being undead, there wasn't much to inhibit their attempts to kill. When the military started to get involved, things really began going to shit. Mass cullings of the infected, and containment of the elderly. People had their cherished grandparents torn from their very arms, being told it was for their 'safety'. A counter-culture quickly formed. People took to the streets to display their disgust at the infringement of their rights. They didn't know which one, of course, but they were still pissed. And there were lots of them. To be honest, their signs and shouting initially amounted to very little - once again, the internet would have had you believe it was all a joke or publicity stunt. That is, in the short run. Eventually, they did gain traction. As livid, stupid masses tend to. So the issue went straight to Congress - or, rather, what remained of it. An amendment to the eighth had to be proposed and ratified, stipulating that '*cruel and unusual punishment*' does not apply in the case of Serca-infected elderly. But law-making and bureaucracy are tricky little things - making an amendment is like trying to slap a buzzing fly. You'll miss the mark a few times, and people will begin to call you out on your idiotic flailing; so you'll try and pinpoint the issue, isolate the fly to a single space from which it can't escape so you can guarantee a kill shot. Unfortunately, this process takes ages. Years, even. Things did not get better in the interim. They still haven't. I can already see my skin peeling at the edges of my body, making way for a greenish tinge on the recovering layer. I've always heard that 'turning' is a long process, but I never realised it was so subtle. If it weren't for the fact I was constantly teething air - or, sometimes, the mangled inside of my cheek - I wouldn't have even been able to know. I suppose it doesn't matter at this point. People are leaving the country, leaving their elderly behind. The protests are still in full swing, and the Government is still twiddling its thumbs. What do I matter in the picture? Just an old man, barely able to get up from his seat without the aid of a nurse that has long since left, slowly, agonizingly waiting for himself to turn. Maybe, just *maybe* - and this is a fleeting hope - life might be better as a zombie. No pain. No inhibition. No stiff bones and sleepless nights. I can already feel my fingers and toes going numb, indicating to me that the first stage of infection is at its end. I hear a knock on my door. When I don't respond, it's followed by a crash, the sound of wood and metal breaking. Footsteps resonate throughout the house; heavy boots against age-old stone. And then, the cocking of guns. They've come for me. The notion of the US armed forces bursting into a retirement home would've almost been funny if it wasn't so morbid. The first stage is ending now. I can feel it. My room takes a reddish tinge - maybe it's simply a trick of the eye or a figment of my imagination. Either way, the effect lingers; a reddish hunger that's reflected in my stomach, which rumbles pathetically. For some reason, I really want to eat. *I really want to.* Second stage: rapid break-down of neural functions. Loss of memory. Loss of ability to communicate, and then loss of cognitive thinking. Rationality makes way for impulse. *What makes way for what now?* Right, the third stage: flesh begins to go through necrosis. Regenerative capabilities arise. I think? I'm honestly not quite sure. Where am I again? Oh, yes, of course - I'm Mark, and I'm 82. Wait, 83. I love my niece, but I can't quite remember their name. do i have a niece? i vaguely recall never having children i always hated them they made me very *hungry*... *Eh?* Right. Of course. That'd just be the turning. I definitely had a child. A beautiful, delicious daughter called... **flesh** *What?* *..................* *............* *. . .* *Ah.* ------ *Im* hungri.

I am the apex of mankind. The ultimate invention. The wheel? Lul. Outdated within the next century. The lightbulb? Bah! Don't make me laugh. When the final day ticks by, and the dawn of time withers to a cold, dim dusk, my sleek, pocket sized form will take its rightful place beside the pantheon of the gods. My screen will glow in the darkness, a new sun reborn. The faded deities of old will marvel and tremble. Their wide-eyed faces will reflect in my beauty. "Why, it streams in 5G!" they might whisper in awe. "That screen quality! None among us dare surpass it!" "Yes, yes, feast your eyes," I would bellow. "I am the God of Interconnectivity and none shall surpass!" **Are you sure you would like to purchase more Lures?** My master Vic presses *Yes* without a second thought. He well-knows he can't afford it. The kid's hardly worked all summer. Yet here I find myself once again, buried in a sweaty palm as Master makes the rounds at Peace Park. It's a real mid-summer cooker. I'm practically simmering in the heat. Eventually, I buzz. "Sick a Charmander," Master says. I think: *Alas! A foolhardy challenger!* Master goes for the normal pokeballs, but I correct this tragic mistake and opt for the great ball. After three or four tries, the great beast is tamed. Another challenger fallen to the wayside. Later in the afternoon, I buzz once more. Yet this time it is no pokemon that dare test my great power. Cupid himself flutters past my screen. And..why, the brazen nerve! His preferred method of challenging me to a duel? A mundane text. Rachel: Hey :) I recognize the name. Rachel. Master has been typing it into search bars for weeks. Browsing facebook photos. Hovering his fingers over that friend request button. My circuits buzz in anticipation. Cupid won't know what hit him. Vic: Sup? Oh ho! What a canvas to work with! I crack my kilobytes and squint my pixels. How to twist such drivel to pure literary genius? I make my alterations with the precision of a seamstress, fine tuning his poor diction to pure poetry ~~Vic: Sup?~~ Vic: Soup? "Oh, goddamnit," Master says. *The surest way to a woman's heart, my friend. You may thank me later.* I feel Master's pulse quickening, even through my sleek exoskeleton. He really, truly, likes this gal. I see you, Cupid, my poor nemesis. I see you raising the stakes... Rachel: No thanks just ate. I dropped a Lure at my place. Want to come chill? Ghost types galore. Master practically gasps. *what did I tell you?* His shaky fingers clunk out a reply. Vic: Cool. I might stop by. Oh no, no, no, no. My friend. What is this? Amateur Hour? Time to weave in a little urgency. ~~Vic: Cool. I might stop by.~~ Vic: ON MY WAY RIGHT NOW MOM DAMN. The seconds tick by. Master looks betrayed. He looks like one might after crashing at the finish line, the billowing tape just beyond one's grasp. *Have faith, for I am mighty* I buzz. Rachel: Lol. Autocorrect? Cool. See you soon :) Master breathes a sigh of relief. For what, I know not. He is in perfectly capable hands. In fact, if I *had* hands, they would be perfectly chiseled. The product of absolutely spotless genetics. I would guide Master through life and he would live happily. Then, when he passed, I would become a hand model. Or, I would strangle Cupid until his eyes pop out. Which clearly I have just metaphorically accomplished. "Siri, get me directions to Rachel's," Master says. Success! Victory! Move aside, dear Cupid you, too, have been replaced by man's marvelous technology. By my absolute celestial perfection. I smile. As much as I feasibly can. I am an inanimate object after all. Mostly, I mean, I just picture myself smiling. I google pictures of phones with smiley faces. But those faces are the highest quality this earth has ever seen. The Gods of old would tremble! They'd stutter an-- "Siri. Directions to Rachel's!" Ah! Yes! Coming right up. Don't you worry. Just a little test of the reception, a probe of the nearby cell towers. My circuitry whirs, my electrons burn hot. And voila! "I'm sorry, did you say Bagels?" Master makes a noise I've never heard before. Suddenly, I'm careening. I'm flying through the air like a Frisbee. I suppose that's one thing those god's had right. At least some could fly. The concrete draws near. Altogether too close. I brace myself for impact and-- I am shattered. I am broken. Splintered to a million pieces. *Why no protector screen? Oh the humanity! Oh the terrible negligence.* Yet, fear not, for my master shall recoup his losses. I will be pieced together with the tender love and care that a creation of my like deserves. "Due for an upgrade anyways," Vic mutters as he dashes towards his car. _____________________ r/writerscrywhiskey

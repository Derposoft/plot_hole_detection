I giggled mischievously as the great clouds smoke dispersed. My heart thumped with excitement. The spell was a success. It actually worked. Now, those smug wizards would stop making fun of me for my lack of talent. They'd stop pointing their long, hairy forefingers at me. They'd-- A lemon rested in the midst of the circle of ash. I cursed under my breath. My eyebrows drew down into a frown. I glowered at the yellowish thing, hunched over it. "You are supposed to be a demon, not a lemon!" In that moment, in a turn of events, the lemon hovered and on its shell small black letters written in flames appeared and faded. They read, *What have you done? Where am I? You took me away from the battlefield.* "Battlefield?" I said, narrowed my eyes. "You are a lemon. Why would you be on a battlefield?" *To squash the army of squashes, of course! I'm the warlord of my people. You condemned us, and for that you shall perish.* "What?" I barked a laugh, grabbed it, and held it close to my face. "I will reduce you to juice, and I'll use you in a proper steak." Black flames burst out of thin air, wrapped the lemon, burning my hand. I screeched, and threw it far away, but the lemon halted mid-throw, as though I were some sort of weakling. I leaped to grab my wand, and in that moment, through the corner of my eyes, I saw the world submerge in shadows. I turned, and found a pillar of enshadowed flames raging toward me. I sprung away, looked desperately around. My bookshelves creaked ablaze, and so did the entire right wall of my house. I barreled toward the door, hearing the hissing and the heat of the approaching flames. Gasping, heart thundering, I opened the door and jumped to the side, barely avoiding the attack. Without hesitation, I dashed toward the University. There the other wizards could protect me. All the while, the lemon followed me, and he did so slowly, and with a terrifying tranquility. When I reached the University, the wizards laughed, convinced I was joking, but then the flames came, and in the sky the lemon rose. We fought him with everything we had. Even the Elders came, but the result was the same: we wound up running away for our lives, losing many. ------------------------------------------------------- A week has passed since I summoned the lemon. Dozens of cities have been reduced to ashes. Three days ago we fought the lemon, and thousands perished. Now, the lemon was coming for us, and he was angry. I looked at the handful of wizards around me. They gave me approving nods. It was time to summon a squash.

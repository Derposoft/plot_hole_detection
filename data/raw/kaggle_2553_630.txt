I can hear them above me, scratching, moving, shoveling. How long has it been since I was buried? I stopped counting at a few days.They're getting very close to me, whoever they are. I can just *feel* the weight of the dirt lifting off the ceremonial prison coffin. It's an odd feeling, so much pressure after so many years, decades, centuries, millennia even. I can't even remember what I was buried for. OH GOD WHAT ARE THEY DOING- I slide in the coffin, hitting my head hard. They're taking me out? Oh I feel queasy. The motion, my head is spinning. I would puke if I'd eaten some time before I heard the scratching. The coffin jolts, the movement stops. I guess I was put down. More scratching, are they trying to open it? Oh please open the coffin, I don't want to be in here anymore- The lid opens, silencing my thoughts. I can feel the air rushing in, oh the cold, crisp air. I take a deep breath, my lungs filling with the intoxicating oxygen. MY EYES! IT BURNS! I hear screams erupting around me, I try to get up but my muscles seize, stumbling out of the coffin onto the grass I haven't felt in so long. I can't see anything, everything is too loud, I'm hurting all over. A whack across my head, I'm out like a sacrificed virgin. &#x200B; Oh god. My head hurts. I rub my head, somehow not confined. Where'd the coffin go- Oh riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight, right, I remember what happened. Wait- which means- I sit up, my back tenses. I'm free, from the coffin, those people, they saved me. I look around, my eyes strained by all the sudden light. I'm in a bed, in an odd white area. I've never seen any of these things before. Oh, there's even little suns in the ceiling. Someone enters the door through a movable hole in the wall. I can see they're startled to see me. They wear odd black clothing, sitting down next to the odd bed I'm on. "Do you know your name?" The person speaks, but, what are they saying?"Yfel tocnawan eow?" I ask back, hoping for some kind of common language. But the person just stares at me, writing."deos fricca eower? yfel macung heore?" I press, hoping to get some clarification. I don't know who these people are, or where I am. "I'm sorry, I cannot communicate with you." They get up and leave again. I look around, seeing an opening in the wall, showing the outside. I get up, holding onto anything that will help, and walk over. I'm going to escape.I try climbing up, but there's some kind of invisible barrier. I knock on it, fully invisible. Maybe it can be broken-!The barrier shatters in little pieces of smaller, sharper barrier, all with a liquid-holding object. I make my escape, seeing the unfamiliar world around me. "Yfel afierran!" I shout, oh freedom feels great indeed. I get the hang of my physical self again, soon I'm running, and oh it feels GREAT! It feels great until I'm hit with a very large and fast object on black wheels. Oh this hurts, a lot. &#x200B; ________________________________________________________ Please don't hate me for the translations, I got it off an Old English translating website so I have no clue if it's accurate. Anyways, enjoy : ) &#x200B; Edit: Oh my god, I did not expect this to blow up so much, my first silver and part two award is thanked Some things I need to address, I wrote a [part two](https://www.reddit.com/user/Variation-Zero/comments/dn9baj/wp_you_are_an_immortal_sentenced_to_a_permanent/) for anyone who didn't see. I wrote this at like 10pm, so I forgot the differences between Britain and America (it's in Britain, I'm just stupid). Thank you for enjoying this!

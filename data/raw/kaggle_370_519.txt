Farmer Greenthumb used to have a simple life, before the *incident*. Since the beginning of time, when he'd found himself in the fields, pitchfork in hand, he'd followed the path life laid out before him. He would walk back and forth through the wheat, occasionally stopping to bail out a heap of chaff before resuming his patrol. The occasional adventurer would pass by his farm, and he greeted every one with equal warmth. They all seemed eager to help, and if asked he would confide that some of the stock was rotting away in the cellar, drawing an ungodly amount of rats to his property. He'd never seen the rats, of course, and he didn't know where the copper coins he used to pay his assistants came from. This never bothered him; it was simply the way life was. To this day, he didn't know what had caused the event that changed the course of his life. Maybe one of the adventurers was the cause: they often sprinted down the road, trailing wild animals and bandits in their wake. Regardless of how it happened, Greenthumb found himself confronted rather abruptly with a large, snarling wolf. Foam dripped from its jaws, and as it lunged at him with deadly intent, he acted on instinct. Before he even knew what had happened, the wolf was dead on the ground, impaled with the glistening prongs of his pitchfork. A trumpet of celebration rang out - from where, he had no idea - and he felt a surge of energy run through his body. As he looked himself over and patted the dust from his clothes, nothing *seemed* to be amiss. Still... For some reason, as he put a boot to the wolf's carcass and ripped his pitchfork free, the notion of returning to his routine felt...unfulfilling. Maybe... Maybe he would just step off the farm for a minute. Just, you know. Have a walk through the woods. --- By the weekend, he had reached level 10. He wasn't sure where the term "level" had come from, but it seemed natural to track each of the milestones that the world seemed ready to reward him for. His pitchfork now felt light as a twig in his hands, and unlike his breathless, fumbling dispatch of the wolf back in the fields, he wielded his weapon of choice with ease. Any thought of going back had long since passed from his mind, and his only concern now was exterminating the nasty infestation of creatures that plagued the mines down the road. Once that matter was taken care of... Well, he would cross that bridge when he came to it. Somewhere along the line, the text floating above his head had changed, but it didn't concern him. The letters had been there since his earliest memories, and he couldn't very well read them from his perspective anyway. Had he been able to, however, the change would have felt every bit as natural as the new purpose he'd discovered for his existence: *Adventurer Greenthumb* *Kobold Destroyer* --- Parts [Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6mt8ow/wp_an_unimportant_npc_character_somehow_killed/dk4ycs2/) and [Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6mt8ow/wp_an_unimportant_npc_character_somehow_killed/dk52iym/) are now available, by popular request

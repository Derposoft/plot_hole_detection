That girl that you're good friends with, but you want more. by t2_4s7byo0s

Have you ever had that one girl that you are really good friends with but you have feelings for her, and you don’t know if she feels the same way? You don’t know if telling them will ruin your friendship. And, you keep saying that you are going to tell them how you feel, but you know that you’re 

Yeah, me too. 

But the only difference is that I told her how I really felt. 

So, there is this girl. I think she is so beautiful and funny and every time we were together, I just had that feeling, but we have been good friends for a long time, and it wasn’t until right before we both left for college, when I told her that I had feelings for her. It was hard for me to tell her this because we were such good friends and I didn’t want it to make things weird.

There was a time when I was dating a girl, we will call her Anna (not her real name) and it was a pretty good relationship. But like a lot of high school relationships, it came to an end. And I was pretty emotional, and this girl was the first person I called (literally) right after Anna broke up with me. Later that day we hung out and that made me feel better knowing that someone would always be there for me. 

This is when I started to **really** fall for her. 

Just being with her after that day, I started to look at her differently and I could see the same with the way she looked at me (or so I thought). 

So now it’s been about a year of me feeling this way about her and I decided it was time to tell her how I feel. Now I felt bad doing this over text, but it was hard for us to hang out a lot and I needed to tell her before we both went to college. So, I typed a long text telling her how I had feelings for her and how I wanted to know what she thought about that (my heart was racing at this point). I see her typing and she types for a decent amount of time and she says “oh really, I had no idea you felt that way about me. But if I’m being honest, I can’t say I feel the same way about you.” 

That hit me pretty **hard.**

Me, thinking this whole time that she felt the same way and I was expecting her to say that she felt the same (but I guess not). But all in all, we are still good friends and we still talk to each other about things every day, but I still have those feelings and I don’t know what to do with them. But this shows that you can tell someone how u feel and if they feel the same way, then that’s great, but if they don’t, then accept that and you can still be there frien

The viscera flowed between my shoes, coating them in a deep, dark red. What was left of the scientists did not appear human anymore - just a mangled mess of bodies and gore. And him. *Me.* He - *I* - looked up at me. He seemed manic, as if crazed from some terrible stupor. "Why do you look like me?" he asked, slowly standing up. He wore no clothes, no helm. "Why do you have my face?" I stared into his eyes; his cold, dead eyes. What had happened here? What fresh hell had I been summoned into? My other self began to wade through the blood towards me. He seemed genuinely curious, almost child-like. I could not move, nor bring myself to scream. All I could do was watch. "Where did I go?" he asked, nearing me. "Why did you come here?" The blood still dripped along the wall, barely discernible, the letters bleeding into each other. Something glinted in the light next to me. A wristwatch, precisely like my own, lay next to a mangled heap of a man. I felt myself shake uncontrollably. He stretched out his hand, beckoning for me, the gore still dripping between his fingers. "*Why am I here again?*" I fell backwards, back into the time machine. It slammed shut, and I the felt that same terrible, twisting turbulence - that feeling of being ripped in two, then pulled back together again. ***** The doors opened. The scientists stared at me, wide-eyed, shocked. *Intact*. Blood still on my clothes. I arose from the machine, shaking heavily, and they all backed away. Something felt so very wrong, like I'd stepped from a dream into a nightmare. "What the hell is wrong with all of you?" I asked them, still shaken, still breathing heavily. I tried my best not to retch. They all glanced at each other. "We didn't think it worked..." one of them whispered, not meeting my eyes. "What do you mean?" I asked, pulling myself out from the machine. My shoes, still wet with blood, felt slick on the cold floor. They all turned to look at someone crouched in the corner, slowly rocking back and forth. I followed their gaze to look at him. To look at *me*. His eyes met mine, and then went wide; and then so dreadfully cold. ***** ***** If you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/) I'll try add new (and old) stories every day <3

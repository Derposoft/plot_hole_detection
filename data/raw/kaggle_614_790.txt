There was a hot, golden haze around the room, and I wondered if I left the stove on overnight. *You didn't,* whispered a voice, that made me flinch. I wondered if it was perhaps my Siri trolling me with a different voice, or my Alexa thinking I asked it a question, but then I heard the same deep, bellowing, echoing whisper ask, *Uhhhh, you uh, you thought about the stove just now right? I can't quite hear your thoughts as well as I'd like could you just talk out loud until I get better at this?* "Ahh fuck am I possessed again," I said out loud, looking in the mirror at my morning hair. "Is that you again Myoryan you piece of shit, I got you exorcised at seven." *Myoryan possessed you?* asked the demon, with his voice echoing all around the apartment. He sounded kind of nervous, like he knew Myoryan was a great demon. *Was he uh, was he good at possessing you? What kind of stuff did he do to make your life tough?* I saw a bunch of upside down faces poke out of the walls, all of which looked like they were pretty worried about something. One of them appeared, then looked like it bumped its head on the wall. An arm and hand came out of the wall so he could massage the lump forming on his forehead. "Is this your first time possessing someone?" I said. *Whaaaaa pshhhh NOOO, pshhh what?* The demon kind of laughed awkwardly as a clay pot I had in the corner formed into a man laughing really awkwardly, and batting a hand at me every so often like I was silly. *You're SILLY, you're so SILLLY, first time possessing someone come ON shut UP.* "It's rather common knowledge that demons don't go through the type of apprenticeship of other occupations, it's okay don't be shy about it," I said. The demon appeared in gray flashes around me with an awkward smile, as he knocked over some of my plants with his hands. He did it really gently though, he just grabbed the pots one by one with both hands, and set them on their side so they wouldn't break and not too much dirt would spill. *You're so SCARED right now, I'm so proud of myself,* said the demon. He kind of coughed, then stuttered as he appeared in flashes on my television screen looking kind of worried. *Say uh, you wouldn't happen to have any friends or relatives that like AREN'T so familiar with demons right? Somebody you know gets scared really easily?* "Oh no you don't bitch you're not going anywhere," I said, as I grabbed a box of honey nut Cheerios and started shoveling handfuls of it in my mouth. "You're staying *right* here with me, you're not torturing anybody else. I know you can't get out till I force you out, and you seem like a punk demon I'm not letting you out of my sight." There was a roar and shake in the room, as the demon roared and started to cry a little like he was kind of scared. There was a sudden darkness, and a sudden fiery flash, before I just saw the demon panting in little clay form again in the corner of the room with his hand on the wall. *Of all the people,* said the demon, as he wiped some tears from his face. *I gotta get the least scared piece of shit, Myoryan's my uncle he kind of runs my department down there. He said you'd be an easy first possession.* "Well tell Myoryan he helped me overcome my fear of cats as a kid, but he can go fuck himself," I said, as I propped my feet up on the coffee table. "I'm not scared of any of you pieces of shit anymore. Killed a lot of demons since that time too, but you don't seem so bad." The demon's eyes appeared in the wall, and sort of looked this way and that way like he was really worried about that last sentence. He swallowed some fiery spit, then appeared in a gray figure beside me on the couch. He put his hands through his charred hair and sort of grabbed his stomach. *Can I have some Cheerios?* he said. *I'm supposed to feed on your fear like Pennywise, but you're not scared and I'm probably going to starve.* "Nope," I said, as I finished up the last of the box. He turned into a darker shadow, and with just the slightest of nods walked away from me and sat Indian style next to my pet turtle swimming around in his aquarium.

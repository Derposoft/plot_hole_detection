"Next!" My agent calls waving the line forward. Another book ready for me to sign, is laid before me. Ah, a copy of my Cultures and Customs of Edo era Japan. I sign it with a flourish even though my hand is getting tired. Smiling up at the woman I lock eyes with her. She was obviously Japanese by descent, but ... I paused glancing down at the book still in my hand. It was impossible, the woman I had watched live her life in Edo Japan had been dead for centuries. Looking up at the woman again, they could have been twins. She took the book, but as she turned she winked. I followed her across the room - where she met up with a group of familiar looking faces. "Rob, I need a water break - I'll... I'll be right back," I said, standing quickly from my chair. I might have several doctorates in History and Language - but I also had a *talent* so to say. While I always found documents to back up my research - I was able to watch it live. I was a Post-Cog. I could walk around, looking but not touching or interacting with any objects or people. I spent more of my waking hours watching the lives of people in the past than I ever did living in the moment. The concept of our ancestors living day to day facinated me. Without the technology we have, without the communications. Their sheer willpower kept them alive. And the fact that some of the people I watched were gone from human memory. No living soul remembered some farmer from the 1860s America, or that concubine from Zhou Era China. But I did. I watched their lives, got to know them as people. Every person I have every watched was factored into my research. And the woman who had just had the book signed was a dead-ringer for the housewife of Edo Japan. I could have waved it away as genetics and a possible descendant if it hadn't been for that wink - and the fact that the group she was with were *all* people I had watched. Even as I stood and tried to get out from behind the little table I had been sitting at for hours I knew it would be too late. Several people tried to stop me and ask questions or clarify details of my books, but I waved them off - trying desperately to get to the group. When I reached the corner by the door where they had been standing, I looked around, hoping to see out the large glass windows which direction they may have gone. I sighed, leaning back against the wall. Digging at the floor with the toe of my shoe I looked around one last time. A copy of the book was laying on the floor. I picked it up - surprised to see it was the one I had signed for the woman. A book mark was stuck into the pages, and I flipped to it. Small details had been circles in red pen. Actions that my editor had said I was embellishing upon but I knew had happened for a fact. On the bookmark was a note - *We know you've been watching us. You're putting our missions at risk. Stop.* What the... Missions? Watching them? The people I watched were long dead. Though I'd never had control of who I watched or when. It seemed to follow one person for months at a time, and then abruptly shift. In that time I would have to figure out who I was watching, where I was, and some record of their lives before I moved to another person. Shuddering, I flipped through the book. The whole thing had been annotated. I started to sink down and start at the beginning when Rob came over. "Man Conner - What are you doing? I thought you said you were gonna get a drink! We have more books to sign. You're blocked for another two hours." He was pulling me back to my feet before I could protest. Gripping the book firmly, I headed back to my table. I had research to do. --- For more stories by me check out my sub r/LandOfMisfits For longer works by me and others check out r/redditserials --- **Part 2 :** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/LandOfMisfits/comments/cg3df2/second_sight_part_2/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LandOfMisfits/comments/cg3df2/second_sight_part_2/)

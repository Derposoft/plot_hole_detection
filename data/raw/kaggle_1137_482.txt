Her mother, in all her bushy-haired, spectacled glory, stood there, hands crossed over her chest, glaring at her only daughter. "Where were you? And what are you wearing?" Rina gingerly pulled back the hood of her white cloak. "Nowhere, mom. And nothing." "You're coming in at 10 p.m. without even an 'I was practicing my incantations' explanation and you expect me to believe that?" Suddenly, she walked up, taking a corner of the cloak in her hand and examined the stitch work. "I recognize this pattern. This is the cloak the members of the church across town wear. You joined a clergy?" "No." She said, expressionless. Her mother blinked, then brought her hand up. A swirling ball of black mist slowly appeared within her palm, and before Rina's eyes, it began to take form, separating into little flickers of life. Rina's eye twitched. Finally, she broke down. "Okay, I was at the church!" Her mother had a terrible habit of conjuring up undead wasps whenever she was unhappy. If getting stung by a single wasp was bad, imagine getting stung by tens of undead wasps that couldn't be killed. Paddling had nothing on her mother. The ball of black mist disappeared. "Okay," Her mother picked up a large tome from the desk and made for her bedroom, her black cloak swishing behind her. "Wait, that's it?" The words popped out of her mouth unbidden. Not that she wanted to be punished, but she had thought her mother would have been completely against her joining the clergy. Her mother turned around. She shrugged. "That's it." "Wait. What?" Her mother blew on a fingernail, examining it. "I was going to ask Pastor Jeremiah to take you in anyway in a couple weeks time. Saved me the time and effort." "I thought you hated the clergy?" "Oh, good lord, no." She laughed at her little joke. "That's how I got my start. How can you understand death if you can't understand life? Besides, where do you think you were made?" Rina took a step back, bumping into the dining room chair. She definitely didn't want to know. She would probably be scarred for life. Her mother walked up anyway, and whispered the words next to her ear. "In the confession booth." Then, she strode into her bedroom and closed the door behind her, leaving Rina standing there, stock-still, wondering if she tore out her ears, if she could un-hear what she had just heard. ***** Parts 2,3 and 4 are now posted! I think this'll probably take 7-8 parts to finish up in a way that makes sense, so everything after part 4 will be posted to my sub just to keep out the clutter.

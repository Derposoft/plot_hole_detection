FADE IN: EXT. A DEEP VALLEY - THE HIDDEN CAMPSITE - NIGHT *Several figures are huddled around a campfire, thick blankets covering each of them. The flicker from the firelight casts curious shadows on the high rock walls at the edges of its glow. Quiet-yet-casual whispers are heard, as if everyone present has grown used to feeling perpetually tense. An alarmed voice shouts from above. This is DEREK.* **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) Stranger approaching! *The figures leap to their feet, throwing off their blankets and revealing that they are clad in worn combat gear. Firearms are drawn, and everyone turns to face the valley's entrance. One of the older individuals looks upward. This is ROBERT.* **ROBERT:** Can you tell anything about him? **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) ... No. **ROBERT:** What do you mean, "no?" **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) He walks a bit like a Steve, but he doesn't seem as confident. He has a Matthew gun on his hip. **ROBERT:** So, when you said "no," what you really meant was "I can't be bothered to extrapolate from available information." **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) I'm not a Francis! Dereks never got any fancy-shmancy logic training! **ROBERT:** Yeah, well, the first Derek was probably a meathead. *One of the figures in the crowd pumps his fist in the air. This is CHAD.* **CHAD:** (*Shouting*) Football! **ROBERT:** Shut up, Chad. **CHAD:** Sorry. **DEREK:** (*O.S*) Anyway, it's not just the Matthew gun or the Steve sneak. He also has a Robert sword in a sheath on his back. *Robert glances down at his own hip, where a machete-like weapon his hanging.* **ROBERT:** On his *back?* *A young woman at the back of the crowd raises her hand. This is SARAH.* **SARAH:** Maybe he's a Jacob? *Robert shakes his head.* **ROBERT:** Jacobs have hand-to-hand training, last I checked. A Jacob wouldn't be carrying a blade. **SARAH:** Well, maybe a Jacob got in touch with a rogue Robert somewhere along the line. **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) He's not a Derek, I'll tell you that. *Robert rolls his eyes, and many of the people in the crowd murmur with mild annoyance.* **ROBERT:** Yes, Derek, we're all aware of your precious sniper skills. **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) Do you think this is easy? Huh? **SARAH:** Yes. **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) You guys get to sit down there by the fire all night, and I'm... *The sudden sound of something slipping on dirt interrupts Derek. Several small rocks fall from above.* **ROBERT:** ... Are you okay up there? **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) I dropped my dinner. **ROBERT:** We'll get you another one. Look, how far away is this stranger? **STRANGER:** (*O.S.*) Uh... hi? *Everyone whirls around to see a young man standing behind them. This is THE STRANGER. Robert sighs and rubs his forehead.* **ROBERT:** Derek... **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) You never asked which direction he was coming from! You just assumed! That's not on me! **SARAH:** I say we shoot him. **STRANGER:** (*Panicked*) Wait, wait, wait! *The stranger holds up his hands and takes a step back.* **STRANGER:** (*CONT'D*) I'm not trying to make trouble! I just want to trade! **SARAH:** That's fine. I was talking about Derek. **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) Screw you, Sarah. *Robert makes his way through the crowd, approaching the stranger.* **ROBERT:** I'm sure you can understand our hesitance to let just anyone into our camp. **STRANGER:** No, yeah, that's... yeah, I get it. **ROBERT:** Let's start with your name. What are you? *The stranger clears his throat nervously.* **STRANGER:** Uh, I'm... look, don't worry about it. *Several seconds pass in silence.* **CHAD:** (*O.S.*) Football! **ROBERT:** Shut up, Chad! **CHAD:** (*O.S.*) Sorry. **ROBERT:** (*To the stranger*) Don't you have a name, son? Something you do? **STRANGER:** Let's just say that it's unique. My parents... well, they had some weird ideas. **SARAH:** Stupid ones, more like. *Despite already looking nervous, the stranger begins to appear even more uncomfortable.* **STRANGER:** Uh, yeah, I... it doesn't matter. I just want to trade. **ROBERT:** I'm not sure you have anything we need. **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) I need some new food, if that counts. **SARAH:** I could use a new soldering iron. Do you have one of those? *The stranger shakes his head.* **STRANGER:** Sorry. I have spare parts, cigarettes, some medicine, survival supplies... you know. The usual fare. **ROBERT:** Oh, so you're like a Srikanth! **STRANGER:** Nah, I can't haggle worth a damn. *The sound of a large explosion in the distance causes everyone to pause and glance at the sky for a few seconds.* **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) Welp, the southern Inclusion Republic outpost just ate it. **ROBERT:** An attack? **DEREK:** (*O.S.*) Looks more like a Dave screw-up, honestly. **STRANGER:** Actually, I just came from there. They had *three* Daves. **SARAH:** That's bad. **ROBERT:** Yep. Emphasis on "had," I suppose. *Robert sighs and shakes his head, then turns back to the stranger.* **ROBERT:** (*CONT'D*) You're welcome to stay here for the night, but you'll have to earn your keep. **STRANGER:** That's fine. **ROBERT:** What can you do? **STRANGER:** Couldn't I just... you know, like, wash your dishes or something? **ROBERT:** Why are you so reluctant to say what you can do? What *are* you, anyway? *The crowd tightens around the stranger, whose discomfort grows. His eyes dart around... but then, he sighs with resignation.* **STRANGER:** Oh, whatever. Fine. Let's get this over with. **CHAD:** (*O.S.*) Football! *A dull thud is heard, followed by the sound of an unconscious body hitting the dirt.* **ROBERT:** Thank you, Michael. **SARAH:** (*To the stranger*) So? Let's hear it, then. **STRANGER:** Okay. So. *The stranger sighs again. He closes his eyes. When he opens them, a complete change seems to have come over him: He is animated, and his face has broken out into a comical grin of nearly manic amusement. Several people take steps back, but nobody says anything.* **SARAH:** I'm getting impatient. *The stranger leans toward Sarah, his insane smile widening.* **STRANGER:** Hi, Getting Impatient! *I'm Dad!* CUT TO BLACK.

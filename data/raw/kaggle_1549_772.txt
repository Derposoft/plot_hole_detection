The television blared in the background as Gip McGuffin rolled off the couch and onto the floor, slowly assembling his life from the blur of the prior day's events. "In local news, a Florida man was filmed wrestling with a street sign in downtown Pensacola. Witnesses say he struck the 'No Parking' sign multiple times with his fist while screaming expletives. Downtown traffic was temporarily re-routed due to the disturbance. A warning to parents that the following footage contains mature content." Immediately afterward a shaky video showed a man in a loin cloth repeatedly punching a sign while screaming it was the only way to save anyone. Gip groaned, and looked down at his mangled hand as a variety of mental health experts weighed in on the news program, pointing to the frayed social net and how these things had become all too common in Florida and elsewhere. Gip fumbled for the controller with his good hand. Finding it, he flipped the television off. Getting to his feet, he stumbled to his bathroom and pried open the medicine cabinet. He lay hold of the aspirin and growled as the child proof top proved frustratingly difficult to dislodge with a single hand. A few moments and profanities later, Gip popped a few capsules into his mouth, hit the faucet on and gulped them down. Closing the medicine cabinet, he examined himself in the mirror. Dark red circles rested beneath each of his eyes and his grey hair was scraggly and unkempt. "Fuck me." The haggard man tore his eyes from the mirror and looked down at his busted hand. He could only wince at the mass of torn flesh and broken bones. It would take time and a helluva surgeon to get that back in working order, but time wasn't something he had. Everything needed to be done in the window and in order. The cost of failure was unspeakable. He couldn't complain, this was what he had signed up for. You didn't get this gig because you wanted to be a hero, you did it because someone had to and you didn't have any other choices. He staggered back down the hallway, turning a corner and heading into his dimly lit bedroom. The desk to the side had a small lamp, which he flicked on, illuminating a small sheet of paper and a black Sharpie. His eyes traveled down the list on the sheet of paper. About half had thick black line line through them. It was difficult to make out what lay beneath, but the entry just beneath the last crossed-out one was plain enough: *Create disturbance from 9:34am to 9:37am on 4th and Williams in Pensacola Florida on 10/13/13. Traffic must be redirected.* Gip lay hold of the black marker and brought it up to his mouth. His teeth clamped down on the cap and he yanked the marker free, exposing the black felt tip. His hand shaking, he drew a line through the latest entry and breathed a sigh of relief. One more task accomplished, one step closer to cleaning up the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to get back home, but at least he'd be able to live his life in peace once the list was complete. It'd been a long time since he'd known a bit of solace, he'd been on the wrong side of the wrong things in the future. This was his chance at a clean slate. His hand was a small price to pay for that. He looked at the next entry on the list and his face paled. *On 10/15/13,* [*spread ashes at Lenscrafters #32 in Sarasota. Claim they are from deceased fiance.*](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Man-Sprinkled-Fiancees-Ashes-at-LensCrafters-Causing-Florida-Malls-Evacuation-Sarasota-Police-228075171.html) Gip stared for a moment, trying to figure out where he was going to get the ashes from a corpse. Or was it enough to simply toss about any ashes? He wished the list was more specific sometimes. Wished that there was some way of getting clarity on what it took to set things right. But that wasn't the way of things. Wasn't how it worked. You went back, you got your list, and you did your job. Two days wasn't much time, and he was working without a hand. Not that it mattered, there were no excuses when it came to continuity rescues. You either got things back on the right path or you dropped humanity into the dumpster. Gip replaced the cap and prepared to make the best of the situation. He had two days. The future was at stake. It all depended on a single man. A Florida man. **Platypus out.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

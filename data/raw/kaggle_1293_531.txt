"What do you mean, 'magnets don't work?'" I asked. "Dude, it means exactly what I said it means, look." John plinked together two pieces of metal and there was no reaction. "These were magnets before but now they don't work," he said. "Here, you try." I inspected the "magnets." based off of the engraved labels (N and S) it looked like they were legit. John was right, there was no attraction or repulsion between the poles. "Are you sure they are not just desensitized?" "No, I was keeping them in this cabinet." Here in John's apartment, things were getting a bit wonky. Outside, there were a few issues too. Big ones. "Let's turn on the TV to see what's going on." "Technology doesn't work." I picked up John's remote control from his old, crusty sofa and clicked the *on* button but nothing happened. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and pushed the side *on* button as well. Nothing. "Aaron, I think we're getting attacked by an EMP bomb or something. I think this is what would happen," John said worriedly. "John, seriously. If there was actually an attack going on, which is *highly* unlikely in today's political atmosphere,  there would at least be horns in the distance or military trucks everywhere." "Yeah, I guess." "And look, all of this could just be-" I was interrupted by screaming and loud noises outside. The curtains to the window outside were closed, so I strode over to pull them open. Outside, a train had derailed and had plowed through several buildings. A fire had started nearby but another, unrelated blaze had begun in the distance. "Dude, it's the End Times," John said. I just stared at the chaos outside, trying to find an explanation to all this mess. --------------------------------------------------------------Meanwhile--------------------------------------------------------------------------- A message hovered in the open space: *Free trial of* ***Universe(tm) pro*** *expired, reverting to* ***Universe(tm) lite*** "Aww man.

"Only losers play this game anyway, like Cthulhu. I'm going to play some interdimensional racquetball now." The now-less omniscient presence logged out of its ***Universe(tm) lite*** simulation and faded into another set of dimensions, frustrated that he was poor and living by himself.

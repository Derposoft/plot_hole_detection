They tried to stop me. *They* tried to stop *me.* *They tried to stop me.* What else was I supposed to do? They got in my way. I had no choice. *Oak door, oak door. The Oracle said the oak door.* If anyone tries to stop me, I stop them. Permanently. "Yes, yes, the oak door." I repeated to myself. It was the only way I could remember what my task was. "What was that, Master?" A small voice spoke from behind me. My servant, my servant with half his face concealed by a mask because he disobeyed me, because I had to punish him, stared up at me. He cocked his head to one side, raising the side of his face that still looked normal. He would never disobey me again. "Nothing, Godfrey. None of your business. Why are you here?" Godfrey bit the inside of his cheek, a small gesture that he only did when he was embarrassed. He pointed outside the window, outside the great tower that I had found and taken on my first visit here. Couldn't find the oak door, but found this useless fortress. "The troops are getting antsy, Master." Godfrey spoke quietly as if my soldiers could hear him all the way up here. "They hunger for blood." I groaned inwardly. My soldiers were *so* needy. Conquer, conquer, conquer, that's all they wanted to do, and they looked to me to lead them, but I couldn't. I wasn't here to conquer and lead. I needed to find that damn door! Who else was there in this strange land that could possibly know of such a thing? Every door to every place existed in every room, they were all connected, so that meant the oak door was *somewhere* in this foul land. Someone of power, no doubt... someone who would want to know what was happening every minute of every day with his kingdom. "Get me my horse." I ordered, and Godfrey snapped into action. _______________________ Outside, the moon rode high, its soft light illuminating the shadowy creatures I had taken as my men. They were all regular men once, but my very touch was enough to turn them into these slinking, slithering beasts. *The Corrupted.* That was what the others called my men. I was the Corrupter. Not that I cared. Once I found that oak door, none of these people would ever matter again. My horse, a sleek, black stallion with pulsing red eyes, paced back and forth, awaiting the oncoming journey. Just like my men, my horse loved to fight, to conquer, and he had a taste for blood that drove him to be the fiercest steed this land had ever known. How he had come under my possession, I couldn't remember. I couldn't remember many things from before, just that I had to find that oak door. I cleared my throat, catching the attention of every single shadow that stood in formation in front of me. Their cloaks swayed and billowed in a nonexistent wind, the darkness dripping off of them like blood off a knife. "I know you all have been awaiting my command, awaiting a new task, a new land for us to conquer. I know that I have been withdrawn these past few weeks, and so your hunger for death has risen beyond your comfortable control. So I hope that, in light of my absence, you will stand with me as I tell you I am here to lead you in battle once again!" My army roared. They howled with glee. It was all I needed to hear. "Tonight, we face the hardest battle we've ever faced before. Tonight, we head for the heart of the land. Tonight, we take the kingdom of Kiseon!" More shouts of excitement. Darkened fists shot into the air, pounding the sky with their enthusiasm. "But I must warn you," I coaxed them back down to a gentle murmur, "this will not be easy. Kiseon is a fierce, powerful kingdom that prides itself on its strength. That is why we must cut off the head before we kill the body." I waited, letting my words sink in. Their heads bent at differing angles, my men awaited the answer to their growing question. "The King is not to be killed." I shouted. "I want him brought to me, alive and unharmed. If we present him to his people in chains, they will no doubt surrender, and we will take their lands. Am I understood?" Another wave of hollers and roars echoed in my ears. I grinned. Taking the Kingdom of Kiseon... why had I never thought of it before? _________ EDIT: Fixed a typo

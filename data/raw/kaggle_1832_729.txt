SCP->!{REDACTED}!< **Item #:** >!{REDACTED}!< **Object Class:** Euclid **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP >!{REDACTED}!< is to be kept inside a Pym-Stark Total Isolation Chamber set to an amplitude of >!{REDACTED}!<. The chamber is to be itself contained within a sealed chamber located at Site 12, guarded by no less than one hundred SCP Foundation Personnel, and Mobile Task Force Omega-18, "The A>!{REDACTED}!<". The existence of Site 12 and SCP->!{REDACTED}!< must be kept a complete secret to all individuals not of the O5 Council or currently on active duty within Site 12. For this reason, SCP->!{REDACTED}!< does not have an associated designation in the Foundation database. This is because several groups of interest have been identified which have a vested interest in releasing SCP->!{REDACTED}!< from containment. All personnel working at Site 12 must be dosed with a suitable quantity of Class C amnestics following the end of their duty period at Site 12. SCP->!{REDACTED}!<-B must be dosed with Rank A7 Psychoactive Enhancements hourly, and monitored continuously for any change in mental state or deterioration of physical form. The continued health and well being of SCP->!{REDACTED}!<-B must be considered one of the highest priorities of the Foundation. Any relevant groups of interest are also to be enlisted in ensuring compliance with the containment procedures of SCP->!{REDACTED}!<. **Description:** SCP->!{REDACTED}!< is a 6"7 purplish humanoid of extraterrestrial origin with abnormal strength, intelligence and force of will. The exact limits of SCP->!{REDACTED}!<'s abilities are currently unknown. SCP->!{REDACTED}!<-A is a golden gauntlet, ornate and made of an as-of-yet unidentified alloy. It is adorned with several gems of varied colors, all of which defy conventional analysis. It cannot be removed from the hand of SCP->!{REDACTED}!<. SCP->!{REDACTED}!<-B is a young empathic extraterrestrial female with pale skin and two antennae. She posseses the ability to influence the thoughts and feelings of others unshielded from her influence - which has a range of touch only. Most notably, she can induce brainwaves associated with deep sleep in all affected living biological subjects, even those usually incapable of sleep. Experimentation on any of the above is prohibited without unanimous consent of the O5 Council. > O5 Note: The fact that this is mentioned is a mere formality for the documentation. All current and future O5 members have been briefed on the risks that this thing poses. As a result, any such requests will be immediately denied. - O5-13. In the year >!{REDACTED}!<, the Foundation Council were directly contacted and made aware of the threat which SCP->!{REDACTED}!< posed to galactic civilization. The exact nature of this contact is unknown - it is currently suspected that the warning was passed through from a future iteration of Dr. >!{REDACTED}!<, who was previously a person of significant interest to the Foundation. Contingency plan Alpha-Alpha was enacted, and Mobile Task Force Delta Six "Agents of Shield" were immediately mobilized to the planet Titan, in the >!{REDACTED}!< system, to begin establishing a Foundation presence. Due to a miscalculation regarding transit times using Xyank/Anastasakos Temporal Sinks in Foundation spacecraft, Foundation personnel arrived to the scene of a battle between SCP->!{REDACTED}!< and several individuals of interest. Significant damage had already been dealt to the planet's surface. Foundation personnel arrived to see individuals attempting to wrestle a SCP->!{REDACTED}!<-A from the hand of SCP->!{REDACTED}!<, and an alien entity, SCP->!{REDACTED}!<-B in the act of sedating it. Foundation personnel immediately stepped in and subdued the individuals of interest, but SCP->!{REDACTED}!<, A, and B, proved incredibly resistant to Foundation arms. SCP->!{REDACTED}!<-B immediately warned Foundation personnel that their actions may lead to catastrophic breach of containment, and that she could not continue to hold SCP->!{REDACTED}!< for much longer. Upon hearing this, the entire site was placed within an experimental Xyank/Anastasakos Temporal Sink Environment to provide dilated time enough for the Foundation to consider other options. Following a lengthy period of proposed solutions, (including the debated use of SCP-682), it was unanimously decided by the O5 Council that the current containment method must be prolonged indefinitely. Rank A7 Psychoactive Enhancements were found to have an unprecedented effect on SCP->!{REDACTED}!<-B in allowing her to maintain stasis of SCP->!{REDACTED}!< indefinitely, whilst remaining herself in a near comatose state. **Addendum >!{REDACTED}!<-A**: As of this week, the containment procedures for this entry are currently under review. After several decades of successful containment, SCP->!{REDACTED}!<-B has begun to show a steady deterioration in physical state, with expected expiry occurring over the next three years.

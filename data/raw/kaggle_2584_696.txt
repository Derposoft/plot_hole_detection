*Dear Diary,* *Today's Log Date:* ***Unknown*** As far as I can tell. I'm 25, how long ago did I turn 25? I'm not really sure, out of being able to sustain myself I never really did learn how to keep track of time, I only could really tell the month I was in. Anyways, its about time I head out. My goal for tomorrow is primarily to find ~~my parents~~ some food, my food supply will last me about two months if I ration it correctly. Sincerely, James *Morning of Departure:* Taking a deep breath and sling my father's book bag over my shoulder and make my way towards the door. With every step I took the pounding of my heart became louder and louder. Gripping the handle I take a deep breath and open the door. Sunlight burst forth into the bunker like a moth to a flame, I could actually see the dust from the bunker, it seemed to dance throughout the bunker! Placing my foot outside the door I cautiously take a step forward. I try to remember what my dad taught me, "If there's enough sunlight to cast a shadow you can use that to figure out what time it is, or if you want something more simple just check where the sun is in the sky." He would give me a lot of lessons like that, I wonder where he got that from... I shake my head and I move towards the remains of my house, walking across my backyard I could see that the grass grew unattended so it came up to my knees and it had knots everywhere. The house itself was barely intact, walls were missing, pieces of the roof had caved in, and debris littered the floor. I open the door and enter my home, what was left of it anyways, "I'm home!" I halfheartedly say knowing no one would answer my call. In the kitchen the cupboards were open and the fridge door was hanging by a single hinge, the living room wasn't much better since there was only the couch and a nonpowered TV, my room was still my room, nothing was seemingly missing or out of place. My copy of Fallout 4 was still on my Xbox, it's a lot different in the game than in the real world, my parents bedroom was still the same. *19 Years Ago* I woke up to a firefighter siren... No... Not firefighter... Not police either, they go **WEE-WOO WEE-WOO!** My mom bursts into my room and grabs my hand, she was moving very fast, faster than I could with my own legs. My father was impatiently waiting through the back door, his face was screaming to me in a really panicky voice. "Hurry up! We don't have much time!" **SNAP!** I come back to reality. *Someone just came into the house.* **CRUNCH!** I squat down and shove my hand into my father's book bag, searching for the one thing he passionately taught me how to maintain and shoot. My hand wraps around the familiar grip and I pull out my father's handgun, I hear footsteps heading in my direction. I take a deep breath, keeping my gaze towards the hallway. Father always told me to listen... One person, that's a good thing. I might stand a chance, they step into the hallway and I stand up with my gun aimed at him. "STOP" the intruder puts their hands up in the air, he's wearing a hood with a scarf covering their face. The stranger pulls down their hood and scarf, *It's a girl!* I don't lower my gun, "Don't back down!" As my dad would always say, She sighs and inspects me with her eyes, "I haven't seen you around these parts. Did you come from a shelter?" "I don't have to answer you." She shrugs "Fair enough, it's not like I care anyway, I just came in here looking for some kid named James." *She's looking for me?* "Why's that?" Another shrug "His parents are a part of my group and our leader finally caved into their request." I lower my weapon "My parent are alive?!"

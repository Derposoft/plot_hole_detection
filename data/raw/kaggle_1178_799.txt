"Listen, we can do this the easy way or the hard way." A hand slammed across Roger Smiley's face, causing brilliant bursts of color to appear in his vision. "Yeah, well, flossing is hard but I still do it twice a day." Smiley turned his head to the side and spits out a tooth. "Guess I got one less place to worry about build up." Halogen lights shining down on his face blinded him, making it hard to make out his assailant. He had his suspicions though. This was the exclamation point on a long run on sentence of bullshit he'd been taking ever since he went the wrong way on Crest. "I don't think you're getting the message Smiley. You're all out alone on this one. No one is coming to save you. Everyone else got with the program, maybe it's time you did too." The man doing the beating pulled his gloves up on his hands, giving them a snugness that can only be acquired from the high quality latex common in the dental field. The man knew his way around protective equipment, but he didn't know anything about the benefits of Crest Cavity Protection ++. The fluoride balance was all off in that shit, it was toxic as far as Smiley was concerned. "Why don't you get on with it? I ain't got all day," he stared up at the dark figure just beyond the edge of the light. "I've got a 9:30 cavity fill to get to." The man raised his hand again and Smiley closed his eyes and braced for impact. But the blow didn't come, instead the sound of a door opening reached his ears followed by the clacking of leather shoes on the cement. "That'll be enough Mr. White, I believe I can take it from here." Smiley cautiously opened his eyes as the sound of a chair being dragged across the cement floor filled the room. Finally the chair came to a halt, the front two legs sitting just inside the circle of light. "I don't know, Mr. White and I were just building up a rapport." Smile said with a grin. The mystery man took a seat. Presenting Smiley with a view below his knees as they entered the light but nothing else. Black, sensible dress shoes, the kind you wore when you spent all day on your feet but still had to look nice. Also the fringe of a white coat, similar to what he wore in his own office. "Doctor Smiley, I think we can leave the banter aside. You have something we want, and I am sure we can provide you with the same." The man's voice was deep, an ominous thunder before the storm. "What I want is better dental coverage from major medical insurers so I don't have to put two thirds of my accounts on credit lines." He loved his patients, but he couldn't afford to run a charity. "Be reasonable Smiley. The other nine figured it out, what's your problem?" "I got into this business to do some good. I'm in it for the pearly whites and the happy moms. When I go home, I sleep easy because my dreams are filled with smiles, not dirty toothpaste money." "All right, not money then. But what about your patients?" A black leather-bound book was brought into the light and opened. "All of these smiles. So much work put into them. Your work Smiley. You're life's work." There was a long pause in the conversation as the procession through the book continued. Flip. Flip. Flip. "You passed up on the easy way Smiley. Now we're just down to the hard way and the harder way." The voice continued, taking on a singsong mocking quality. "What's it going to be? You going to be our happy tenth or we going to do some deconstructive surgery on some of your patients?" Smiley filled with rage as he saw little Billy Atkins go by, his giant grin showing two front teeth missing. The picture was from last week. Billy had been afraid his teeth would never come in and Smile had spent an hour showing him x-rays so he knew they'd come back. That they were just getting ready to make their big appearance and he should enjoy his window smile because it was the only time he would have it so it was special. That was why he got in to the tooth jockey game. For them. Screaming, he stood up, dragging the chair he was handcuffed to along with him. "You're gonna pay for this. One out of ten dentists agrees." He dove into the man, his teeth gnashing until they sank into something soft. He'd floss it out later. **Platypus out.** **Want more peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

And who should be coming down the sidewalk outside the yoga studio but Patrick Evans. His hair looks feathered today, and he swept it back off his brow in a high wave. My mind goes all over the place for a second, almost like I need to confirm that my skin cells haven't blown away in the wind. Our eyes meet. He glances to the side, takes a quick half-breath, then looks back to me and puts on a bright smile. Patrick: Hey, Tricia! Secure in the knowledge that my skin cells are firmly attached to my body, I return his smile. Me: Hi, Patrick. He fingercombs his hair. Patrick: I didn't see you at the show yesterday. *Agnes: I knew it. Somebody hired him to take us out.* *Brad: Um, no. His cheeks have reddened and he touched his hair! He's soooo nervous. The research indicates he's either suffering from crippling social anxiety, or he's totes into us.* *Agnes: Maybe he's into us, and so he's guilty about having to take us out.* *Me: He's not an assassin. Nobody's an assassin.* *Agnes: I am. You are.* *Lucy: This is all secondary to our need for a* verbal response, *people. Time's a-wasting. Clock's a-ticking.* *Brad: Lucy's right. His eyelids just narrowed. That's a micro-expression of impatience.* *Agnes: Don't tell him that we stayed home to marathon Breaking Bad and eat ice cream. He'd be able to track our patterns.* *Lucy: Don't mention we stayed home to marathon Breaking Bad and ice cream because, you know. Just don't.* *Me: What do I say?* *Lucy: Aloof. Be aloof.* Me: Yeah, I had other plans. Patrick: Oh, right. Well, I'm glad you had a good time anyway. *Lucy: Too aloof! He took is a rebuff! Follow up with a question! Give him an opening!* *Brad: And, like, push your hair behind your ear. Guys respond to that, like, subconsciously.* I push my hair behind my ear. Me: How was the show? Patrick, whose smile had faded, lights up. Patrick: It was great! Really, really great! They had this really intricate light show synced to the entire performance. They opened with... *Agnes: How do you think he'll do it? Poisoned lip-stick? Stilleto to the back while we're making out?* *Me: He's not an assassin!* *Lucy: Agnes, you're paranoid.* *Jeff: I've been taking notes. Agnes, you've predicted that... 67.3267% of the people Lucy has met this year were assassins.* *Agnes: Better safe than sorry. And I haven't always been wrong.* *Jeff: You've been correct... 0.01% of the time.* *Brad: Oh yeah. I wonder how Mary's doing. Her ears were huuuge.* *Lucy: And remember that pun she made? Knife to meet you? That was bad.* Patrick: ...so really really great. I don't want to say that you missed out, but you did kind of miss out. *Agnes: But I* was *right. So. Keep that in mind.* *Lucy: I like that he didn't straight up say we missed out. Softened the blow. That's tact.* *Brad: And there was that slight pause before he said it. I think he was thinking about whether he should say it or not.* *Lucy: He's a sweetheart.* *Me: Where do I go from here?* *Jeff: You have messed things up with 3 out of the last 4 guys you've had crushes on.* *Me: Thank you for that, Jeff.* *Jeff: That fairly constitutes a pattern.* *Me: And for that...* Patrick: Are you ok? You seem a little spacey today. My face blooms red. *Brad: Balls. He thinks we're a weirdo.* *Lucy: It's fine. Acknowledge and move on.* Me: Just a little lost in my thoughts, you know? Patrick: Yeah, I hear you. Sometimes I get into a situation and it feels like there's too many parts of me wanting to talk all at the same time. Me: Like you find yourself arguing with yourself? Patrick: Constantly. I even give the different parts of myself names. He blinks and swallows hard. Patrick: Sorry, do you think that's weird? *Brad: Huh.* *Lucy: Yeah. Huh.* *Jeff: This is a first.* *Agnes: Definitely a hitman.* Me: I see it like this: People are always saying that it's fine to talk to yourself, but you're crazy if you respond to yourself. But I don't think that's true at all. How else can you talk to yourself than by responding to yourself? And, also, there's more to people than a single personality, you know? Like a person can be one person around their parents, another around their friends, a third at school, and on and on. And so, like, it's not weird if those different personalities sort of interact. You know? Patrick: I do know. He rubs his shoulder and looks at the ground. *Brad: Oh dear. That may have been too much.* *Jeff: I'll update the stats to 4 out of 5.* *Lucy: Shut up, Jeff. But yeah, that was a real gamble.* Patrick lifts his head, sets his jaw, and holds my gaze. Patrick: Wanna get dinner this weekend? We can have some wine and let all our personalities out. *Lucy: Boom!* *Brad: Go for gold, sister!* *Jeff: Nevermind. 3 out of 5.* *Agnes: I'm willing to consider the possibility that he might not be an assassin.* Me: Sure, I'd like that a lot.

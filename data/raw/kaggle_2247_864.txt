"A-- A jerk butt?! I am *not* a jerk butt!" the alien yelled indignantly, pulling his weapon back from my face. "Yeah you are, and your mom is a poopy pants too!" I yelled, wiping the sweat off my face to try and look more intimidating. "Mom?" it asked. "Uhh.. your leader is a poopy pant?" I said hesitantly. "Nuh-uh!" the creature yelled, flailing its arms and dropping its weapon on the ground. That didn't bother it at all as it warped right up to an inch from my nose and hissed, "Leader. **Is not.** A poopy pants." "Your breath stinks too," I replied through closed eyes. It terrified me, and I couldn't look at it when it got so close. But its breath was actually surprisingly pleasant. "AAHHHHHHH!!" it screamed and ran out of the room, its screams following it down the hall. I dove to the weapon and tried to figure out how it worked. It looked nothing like a gun and I couldn't find anything that resembled a trigger. I only knew which side to point away from me, but otherwise couldn't tell how it would function. I pointed it away from me and bashed against it a few times. Nothing. Multiple footsteps were approaching from the hallway now. A battalion of creatures. I looked around the room for shelter. Only a few desks and chairs. That's what I get for hiding in the office. I swung the weapon around more to no avail as about a dozen of the creatures came around the corner and stopped when they saw that I held a weapon. With only a moments hesitation, they put up shields that would presumably protect them from the weapon, since they were no longer fazed by my swinging it around at them. The largest of the creatures floated ahead of the rest, its arm around the shoulder of the one I insulted earlier. "This is human?" "Y-- yeah, that's the one. He called me... He said the mean things..." the alien said sheepishly. A gun was trained on me in an instant and I dove behind a desk. The place I stood only a moment earlier burst into flames. A projectile never even left the gun, the location was just incinerated instantly. I took a deep breath to calm my nerves and tried to speak as fast as I could, "Why are you helping the one that called you a fat loser?" I yelled from behind the desk. I heard the weapon powering up. Maybe this larger creature was more immune to insults. If that was the case, I was done for. "And he said he would bring you over to show me how fat you were and all of the other people were uhh... sweaty whale aliens-- I mean sweaty whale things! He called you all things!" Without even giving me a response, the weapon fired again. My eyes were screwed shut, but I heard something scream from behind the desk. Peeking my head out, I saw that multiple aliens and shot and disintegrated the alien that brought them all in. My eyes widened in fear when the larger one turned to look at me. There was some green fluid streaming down its head. Their blood was blue, so I couldn't tell what this was. "Did Yulzhag really say all those things?" the larger one sputtered. It was crying! The green was some kind of tears! "Oh yeah, but that's probably because he heard it from all his friends behind you. I mean, they all call you a... a goose butt and a yucky gross thing whenever you're not in the room," I said, knowing that my lack of insults would probably lead to my death. The leader looked back to the others. "My own brothers," it said, rage enveloping its being to the point of changing the creature to a hue of red. "Brother no!" one called before the group of them all exploded. It turned back around to me as I stood shakily from the floor, weapon still in hand. "You're nice, right?" it said, sniffling and crying more green ooze. I had no idea what would lead to my death anymore so I just nodded quickly, too exhausted and full of fear to come up with a new insult. I dropped my gun, which went off as soon as it hit the floor. It blew off the lower half of the alien. It only cried out in pain, breathed once loudly, and whispered painfully, "Liar." Somehow it hurt to hear him say that to me after he trusted my word so much. It died without another movement and I sighed in relief. I made my way down the stairs preparing a litany of insults in case I made contact with any more of the things. On the next floor down, I heard something dart around the corner and let out a war cry when it caught sight of me. I dove behind a shelf as fast as I could and yelled, "What's wrong, smelly?" It stopped in place, and let out a long, offended gasp. _____________________________________________ For more silly stories, come check out /r/Nazer_The_Lazer!

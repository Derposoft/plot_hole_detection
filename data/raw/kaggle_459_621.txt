"Oh boy" I thought to myself when I first saw him running down the steps towards me. It looked like I had my work cut out for myself, the guy had even taken off the standard armor. His skin glowed bright pink, over his head hung the name: 420yoloswag. I sighed. The usual newbie I could handle, they might be a lot of work but at least they took the game seriously. You could tell their characters were meticulously edited to look badass, sometimes maybe even supposed to be a heroic version of themselves. But this mess running towards me? Well, *this* seemed to be a very tiring combination indeed: Incompetent and indifferent. But it couldn't be helped. It was my duty to help transform this sorry soul into the savior of our world, although I didn't get my hopes up. In all probability all this guy would turn out to be was someone who quits after countless failed attempts at Smoughstein and Orn. But I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, let's hope a good first impression could be an essential step in the right direction. Thus, I drew myself up to my full height and intoned in the most epic of voices: "Welcome young traveler! I am -" I felt a sharp pain in lungs as my breath was violently cut short and my dialogue skipped. The audacity! This guy dared to skip my first line! The first line in the *entire game!* Luckily you don't get to be a tutorial character without having the patience of a saint. I had endured tens of thousands of noobs, I would endure this one aswell and just maybe he had only skipped it by accident. I braced myself and continued. "You must -"There, again! This guy! I had half a mind to beat him to a pulp then and there but rules were the rules, he hadn't attacked me so I had to go on. "See"- "I"- "I"- "O"- **"Will you cut that shit out!** The words had come out of my mouth before I was able to stop them. Shocked I looked into the pink grimace that was the face of 420yoloswag. It was hard to tell but it seemed to look confused. That and the fact that this line hadn't been skipped told me that he (or she it was hard to tell) was just as surprised at this turn of events as I was. But now the floodgates had been opened and I couldn't hold back any longer. "I mean I'm trying to explain some shit to you right here! Do you not care about the rise and fall of the ice giants? The dawn of the age of heroes? How about how to swing a bloody sword? That stuff might come in handy you know! I breathed heavily, arms raised in the air waiting for whatever this poor, poor excuse for a "*hero*" had to say for himself. At last the crack that was his mouthed opened. "Dude I don't know what you think you're doing, but I'm trying to set a world record here. Thanks to you this run is dead before it even began. So I'm gonna reset and when I get back you better stick to your character or it will not end well for you. And before I could wrap my head around what on Dranlor this was supposed to mean I felt the world around me cave in and fall away as this game file was being deleted. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ *English is my second language if you come across any phrases that sound odd or any weird grammar please let me know, it helps me improve.

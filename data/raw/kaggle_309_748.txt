The ten-year-old e-mail was followed by a black screen with one button at the center. It read 'Call Your Past?' The question mark was what intrigued Adam. That and he was just the right amount of drunk, high and depressed. He stretched the laptop across the sea of empty Dorito bags and beer bottles that was his living room floor, sat down in front of it and clicked 'Yes'. And his face showed up onscreen. His twenty-three-year-old face. Ten years in the past. Both Adams stared. Neither sure of what to say. "Wow," his younger version said, finally. "You look like shit, bro. I barely knew it was you. Well, barely knew it was me, actually. Well... you know what I mean." Adam brought his hand to his mouth. It was him. Really him there. He had no memory of that call... or did he? It was all fuzzy from the alcohol. From the drugs. From the sadness. His twenty-three-year-old self looked handsome. Clean. His hair. God, Adam loved that hair. "You've balded at the same rate you let your beard grow, dude," Young Adam said. "What the hell happened to you?" Adam just stared. "Are you... are you... really...?" "Really you? Well, I clicked a 'Take Call From Your Future' button, so I guess yes." His young self shook his head. "Though... if I knew what I'd look like ten years from now, I wouldn't have called." Adam stretched and kicked a half-full bottle of bud. He grabbed it before it all dripped. He took a sip and it trickled down his beard. He blinked red eyes at the screen. He realized he had absolutely nothing to say to his young self. Nothing positive. Nothing that could help. "Huh... look, man... I was gonna ask you some pearls of wisdom or some shit," Young Adam said, "but it's clear you have some shit to figure out there, and I don't think you're really the best person to be giving advice... so I'm gonna hang up now, okay? Whatever it was that happened to me in these next ten years, I don't even wanna know, cause Jesus Christ it looks ugly..." Adam sniffed. He blinked. He was confused. He sipped his beer. Was this real? Was this the drugs? "So... see you, future, trashy, drunk, weird me," his young self said, and reached for the laptop to hang up the call. "Wait." Adam grabbed the laptop. His eyes were unfocused. His head was heavy. "Wait." "What is it, hobo-me?" Young Adam laughed. "Can I... can I see them? Please?" "Them? Who the hell is them?" Adam counted inside his head. Twenty-three... she would have been six months old then, give or take. "Emily," Adam blurted. "And Jessica." "My wife? My daughter? What the hell do you want with them? Go talk to your own family." "Please? Just for a minute." Young Adam puffed his cheeks. He bit his lips. "All right. But quick, okay? I don't want my daughter looking at you for too long. You look like a mug shot come to life." He left the frame. Adam sipped the warm beer. There was a cigarette butt inside the bottle. He was dizzy. Everything spun. How high was he? How much did he take? When was the last time he had smiled? There was movement onscreen, and, a second later... there she was, just like Adam remembered her. Emily. Beautiful. The kind eyes. The long hair. The smile. Everything. Everything just the way it was. And Jessica. The baby. So tiny. So small. Adam could smell them, almost. Could feel their touch. Could almost remember. Could almost smile. "Hi..." he blurted, between tears. Emily looked off-screen. "Who the hell's this guy, honey?" From out of frame, Young Adam answered, "Just my future self. Say hi and then let's go. We're late." Emily turned back to the camera and smiled a shy smile. She waved. Adam choked. He bit his hands to stop from crying. He waved back. They were so beautiful. So very beautiful. "Well... okay... bye then, future Adam," Emily said. She left and, a second later, Young Adam took to the screen. "All right bro," he said. "Gotta go. Keep rocking the... party life, I guess, by the looks of your apartment." Adam sniffed. He touched the laptop screen. He stared at his younger self. He pulled a breath. And then he said, "Drive carefully." But he knew his young self wouldn't listen. ________ /r/psycho_alpaca

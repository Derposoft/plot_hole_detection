**Reassimilation Log 237B** Subject has been released into urban environment. Appears stable. Selective memory protocol is in place; in the event of severe injury or death, utilize shutdown command. *** God, my head hurts. I'm really pissed off and I'm not sure why. I want to punch something, kick something, destroy something. Deep breaths, in and out. I pulled the first string on my finger a few seconds ago and got no clarity whatsoever. Just a series of scattered images and voices, squeezed into the corner of my peripheral vision, that told me I was at risk of "knowing too much." One more couldn't hurt, right? I walk down the alleyway while the memory plays out. I'm sitting on a park bench with a young woman, neither of our faces visible. I whistle the first few phrases of *The Andy Griffith Show* theme, and she whistles through to the end. OK, great. It's kind of soothing to watch but doesn't give me any answers. As soon as I reach 5th Avenue - swarmed by people coming at me from all corners - my headache gets far worse. Fight or flight, fight or flight -- ? Fight. A man in a black suit carrying a briefcase approaches me and I punch him in the stomach. "What the fuck, man?" I grab his briefcase and sprint back down the alley, then climb a fire escape and end up on the roof far faster than expected. Good God. I pull another string - more scattered voices and images. "You'll be confused at first...disoriented. But we have to do this all or nothing. When you've seen the things you've seen, there's no way to ease back into it. Every ounce of you will be panicking, but you have to fight that." Well, I can clearly *fight*, at any rate. Time for another string. There I am, railing away at a punching bag in some nondescript gym bathed in fluorescent light. So I'm in good shape, I have (had?) a significant other, and I have a penchant for stealing briefcases. I ditch the briefcase and head back to the street. The guy I punched doesn't seem to be around. Deep breaths. Next string - a teenaged girl, tilting her head, smiling. She resembles me. Why does everyone here look like an enemy? Another string...A family photograph being taken: me, a woman who seems to be about my age, and the same teenaged girl. I'm about to punch the guy to my left but I hold it in. I reach for my back pocket - is that a gun? I pull it out, aim for the man in front of me, get ready to fire -- But pull another string instead. My apparent wife and daughter crying as I'm lifted out of an ambulance on a stretcher. A man in a police uniform next to them. My wife signs some paperwork. I have to find them. Another string - an apartment building on 7th Avenue, then the flash of a number on a door, 742. I can do this. Don't panic, breathe breathe breathe. I find the building, head inside, take the elevator. Another string - it's me in the same elevator, younger and less terrified. I knock on the door of apartment 742, and there they are. Both of them. They embrace me and I start crying but I'm not sure why. The anger is receding. "What the hell is going on?" I ask. "I can't remember your names...I'm sorry..." They're both crying. The older woman half-smiles, half-frowns. "I'm afraid there's not a lot we can tell you about the past," she says. "But you're here, and that's all that matters." *** **Reassimilation Log 237B** Subject successfully returned to residence. Does not appear to be aware of former status. Punched one civilian but did not fire blanks out of gun placed in holster around waist. Removed nine of ten strings at far more accelerated pace than anticipated. 237B, aka Officer Jay Phillips, represents first successful case of reassimilation after failure of pilot program. Following injuries in the line of duty, Officer Phillips consented to experimental bio-mechanical implants that enhanced his physical abilities and overall situational awareness. However, Phillips' consciousness had to be temporarily deactivated after implants caused impulsive violence against civilians. Phillips has not yet pulled final string...appears to have forgotten about it. If he unties it, he will know the truth about his condition and history. Perhaps it is for the best that he is unaware.

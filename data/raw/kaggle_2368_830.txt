For a moment, it was there. A shining emerald, a deep and throbbing green like healthy spring grass. The next, gone. *Strange,* I think. But who knows. Sometimes you're just seeing things, and it happens to everyone. Walking into the backyard, I take off my shirt, feeling the pleasant heat of the sun. Should put on some sunblock, I guess. The bees buzz lazily in the flowers my wife recently planted, bumping and bustling as they land and takeoff again and again. Somewhere, a grasshopper chirps. A pleasant afternoon, if I were to have any say about that. I put down my phone on the glass table, and walk to the side of the pool. The water is a deep cerulean, undoubtedly cold in the early morning. Think I'll take a dip. Get off reddit, get off the internet, and just have a pleasant morning. I walk to the ladder, and carefully dip one toe, then a foot, then just say fuck it and slip into the smooth waters. A little deep, but I like deep water. I like to be immersed in it, to float to the bottom and hold my breath and just be there in the pulsating quiet. Relaxing, I guess. Like meditation. I let the water take me, filling the world, and come down, down to the bottom, and after a gentle scrape of the knee, I close my eyes. And sit. And sit. And sit. I come up for air. A little backstroke, and I look up, huge white clouds strolling across the sky at a leisurely pace. No one's in a rush today, I guess. Back and forth. Swimming from one side to the other. To the ladder. To the wall. To the ladder. To the wall. The wall. The wall. The wall. Where the fuck is the ladder? *That's impossible,* I think, but it's gone. And the sides - dear God the sides of the pools are too high. I can't pull myself up, never needed to, never thought about it. A ladder is a ladder, they don't get up and walk away, they don't move, and they certainly don't disappear. "Kendra!" I yell. "KENDRA!" And it dawns on me. She's gone for the weekend. She's gone. And I can't get out. I swim back and forth. Back and forth, calling and screaming until my voice goes hoarse. First one leg cramps. Briefly. But it'll come again. I shout for anyone, the neighbors, the police, someone, anyone to come and help me, but its to no avail. The sun beats down, long and hot and cruel, and it watches dispassionately. All it does is shine. *Having a nice swim there?* it asks me. *Having a nice day? Sure is relaxing?* I'm afraid now, the fear at first a small nibbling rodent, taking small bites from the inside. Then growing, manifesting, swarming, squabbling, and ever present. I scream as much as I can, but no one comes, no one listens, no one can hear me, for whatever reason. I can hear lawnmowers droning, the buzzing of the bees, the splashing of the water, and each stroke becomes harder than the last. A great beast in the belly, all consuming, panic, and I know I shouldn't, I know I shouldn't panic, someone must hear, come get me, come help me, but I start to flail and scrabble at the sides, to claw and my fingers begin to ache with pain, fingernails cracking and blood beginning to create small swirls in the water. I'm tired. I'm so tired, and the legs begin to cramp and I can't hold myself up anymore, and I'm falling down, down to the bottom, and the water fills my lungs, my nose my mouth, I need to breathe but I can't. I'm dying. I'm drowning. I'm drowning. *It hurts,* I think, and before I can think anything else, there's nothing left. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *An overweight young man gets off reddit, and looks back to the screen of his desktop. The little fucker finally drowned it seems.* *Took much longer than expected.* *He looks outside, and sees it's such a lovely day.* *He gets out of his chair, and puts down the phone, after wiping Cheeto dust onto his pants.* *Maybe he'll go for a swim, then come back, and drown the wife when she gets back home.* *Walking to the backyard, he passes a mirror.* *And sees a bright gem above his head. A shining emerald, a deep and throbbing green like healthy spring grass.* *Then it's gone.* *He shrugs, and thinks nothing of it.* *"Lovely day for a swim," he says to himself.* *A bright morning.* *A warm morning.* *It'll be a good day, probably.* *He doesn't know he's being watched. Doesn't realize there's someone above, with Dorito dust on their fingers and a warm beer at their side.* *Watching.* *Waiting.* *Ready to continue the cycle.* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- r/storiesfromapotato - for stuff from me r/redditserials - for stuff from me and others

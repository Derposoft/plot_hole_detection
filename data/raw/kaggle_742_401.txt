"Death! Buddy!" Aleksei threw his arms open and charged across the room toward the looming specter in robes of shadow. Aleksei had been a huge man in his time, but now he was almost comically short compared to the rest of the human race. He made up for it by wearing the most garish of clothing in whatever style was considered 'in' at the time. Today it was a long, sudosilk robe that was programmed to shift between patterns of purple and deep crimson. Underneath he wore an obnoxious yellow shirt and puffy, green pants that looked like they were metal but moved like fabric. The charging rainbow that was Aleksei Roda slammed into the bone-thin figure of Death and squeezed the shadows out of him, "It has been so long, my friend! Come, come, I must show you my new toys!" **ARE YOU PREPARED FOR ME?** "No worry, my friend!" Aleksei puttered over to a door on the far side of the living room, pressing a button to reconfigure the room. The walls moved back to show a messy workshop full of hundreds of half-assembled machines. "I can have CAIN add a guest room onto the house. It will only take an hour or so. You are welcomed to stay as long as-" **THAT IS NOT REQUIRED** Death flowed over the floor toward Aleksei, **I HAVE COME FOR YOU ONCE MORE. YOUR TIME HAS LONG SINCE PASSED.** "What?" Aleksei laughed and slapped his hand at death. "Die now? No way! There's so much I haven't done yet! There's still so much to see! We have a colony on Du-Roga now, did you hear?" **I HAVE COLLECTED FROM IT MANY TIMES.** "Oh, of course you have. You're always there right behind us, aren't you? Well, how is it? C'mon, tell me about it! I have a transit visa for next year. I can't wait! A new world, new people, a whole new sky to watch at night!" **ALEKSEI RODA. YOU HAVE LIVED BEYOND YOUR TIME AND THE TIME OF MANY OTHERS. I ACCEPTED YOUR CHALLENGE BELIEVING YOU TO WASTE AWAY LIKE MANY BEFORE YOU. YOU FAIL MY BELIEF. YOU FAIL EXPECTATION. DO YOU INSIST ON LIVING STILL? DOES TIME NOT BECKON YOU TO ITS END?** "Aw, man. Death! Buddy! Come on now, lighten up." Aleksei set his hands on his wide and well-padded hips. "Live a little!"

"Jolly good show, my good man," he said, sitting on the right of my shoulder and inhaling deeply from his pipe. "Positively smashing." I'd been watching Stranger Things for the last couple hours, trying to block them out. "What kinda trash is this?" the man on the left of my shoulder chimed, pacing up and down the length of it. "This is just garbage, garbage I tells ya. Barb don't deserve to go like that." I sighed. I had not been succeeding. ******** The bank teller peered quizzically at my shoulders, and I tried to smile. "Please, it's best to just try and ignore them," I told her, glancing down briefly and praying that Mike would be able to keep it together. "It's an, errr, *condition*." "Nice rack on this bird, yaknowwhatI'mtalkin'about?" he said, staring directly at her chest. Charles leaned over to chastise him. "Now now Mike, what have we told you about manners? Although I dare say, that is certainly a bountiful bosom." I apologized profusely before security could escort me out. **** After much deliberation, the two of them convinced me to go out to the library. This was always a challenging affair, as libraries were made for silence, and regardless, the three of us would need to pick a book that all of us liked to read. No such book existed. I - or we - were browsing the aisle, Charles trying to direct me to eighteenth century geopolitics, Mike complaining that there were no porn mags. I whispered for them to be quiet, and in the ensuing silence I heard three women speaking in increasing volume to my right. The librarian shushed the women, and I heard one of them apologize, then the three continued in hushed voices. Again the librarian told them to be quiet. I rounded the corner, engrossed in my quest for fiction, and accidentally bumped into one of them. Well, *all* of them. "Watch where you're goin', ya fuckhead!" a tiny voice said while I attempted to pick up the fallen books. "Fran, please watch your language, as I think you'll find we are in the company of gentlemen," another tiny voice said, as I - or we - slowly looked up. A beautiful woman stood before us. Furthermore, two more women stood on *her*. "By Gods," Charles said, dropping his pipe. "Fuck me," Mike replied. "I... I..." I stammered. "Please, don't mind them," the woman said with a nervous smile. I nodded, still speechless. I'd never been able to talk to girls, not with these two on my shoulders. But this... This could work. "Take this guy to pound town before I do it myself," the tiny, brash woman on her left chimed. "Or perhaps a delicatessen first?" the tiny, posh woman on her right replied. The librarian shushed us on our way out. **** If you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/) I'll try add new (and old) stories every day <3

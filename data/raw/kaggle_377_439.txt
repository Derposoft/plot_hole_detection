The capsule, encased in darkness, suddenly opened. A hand reached in, grabbing me by the arm and roughly lifting me out. I gasped as the pressure difference hit my lungs. "Twenty-something male, sir," the voice said, pulling me out from the capsule. I blinked, the hard light flashing in my eyes. *Why wasn't I dead?* A man, clearly his superior, approached us. He looked at me impassionately. "He still alive?" The other man looked me up and down. "More or less." The captain nodded. "Great. Put him to work." **** I gripped the gun turret, feeling at the levers. The technology felt so... archaic. I noticed blood smeared across the controls and some hasty soldering work. This weapon had been recently repaired, and it was done in a rush. There were lights in the distance, approaching fast. The man who'd found me in the capsule here patted me on the shoulder. "Remember kid, you fight them off, you live. You don't, you die. Easy enough, eh?" he said, lighting up a cigar. I thought the gaping maw of the black hole would be the last time I'd ever be scared. That I'd finally get a respite from my hellish life. And now, I'd been thrown into an entirely new hell. "*What the fuck is going on?!*" I finally blurted out, unable to contain myself anymore. "We're being pursued, kid. Captain told us to stop off at the edge of the event horizon, grab a couple of new 'recruits' after our last battle," he said, climbing into his own gun turret and readying the weapons. "They'll be arriving any minute now." "The 'edge of the event horizon'?" "Sure, where all you scum get sent to. Most of you survive the trip - then you're just a bunch of idiots floating in space," he replied. He started up the weapon systems. "You should thank us, really," he added as an afterthought. I thought for a moment. It was all going so fast. I tried to move, to get out, then realised I was locked in place. I was trapped in the turret. "So you're... slavers?" I asked, dreading the answer. "*Slavers?* Heh, have a bit of respect mate," he said, taking a long drag of his cigar. He watched the lights approach, and aimed his crosshairs on the closest one. They were flashing a distinctive blue and red. "We're pirates." He blew out the smoke, tossing his cigar and putting his finger to the triggers. "*Space pirates.*" ****** [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/6n70mn/wp_salvaged_ii/) If you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/) I'll try add new (and old) stories every day <3

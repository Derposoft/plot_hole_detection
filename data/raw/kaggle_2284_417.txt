**WHY?** ---------------------------------- "Quick, grab the wand and shout the incantation while looking into your heart! We need you to transform to fight off Yin the Evil! He's already turned those poor policemen into potatoes and magic's the only way to beat him!" *Well, guess I gotta trust this floating, shiny, annoying-as-shit mofo if I'm going to defeat this "ancient evil",* Rim thought as she grabbed the shining blue object. "YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN STOP ME? I'VE DEFEATED YOU WEAK MAGICAL GIRLS IN THE PAST. WHAT'S ANOTHER ONE TO THE LIST!" *Damn, it's so annoying when stereotypical villains monologue and brag about those they've defeated. Trust your heart. Trust your heart.* "MAGIKA SOKAN!" Within a second, blue light exploded in the area and blue smoke filled the air. Rim smiled. She knew instantly that Yin. Fucked. Up. ~~-----------------------------------------------------------------------------~~ As Yin stared into the smoke, he wondered who would fall to his dark magic this time. "COME OUT NOW? I NEED TO BANISH YOU ONCE AND FOR ALL FOR THIS...ANNOYING-ASS FAIRY TO STOP GETTING IN MY WAY?" Silence filled the air. "AW, COME ON ALREADY. WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY, YOU KNOW?" More silence. "YOU KNOW WHAT? SCREW THIS." In an instant, Yin fired five bolts of transformation magic into the smoke only to hear a growl. Almost immediately, Yin was met with a gigantic dual-edged axe flying towards him, smashing a police car as he barely dodged it. "WHAT THE FUCK WAS TH-" Yin could not finish his sentence as a massive, glowing-green, clawed fist smashed his face into the back-edge of the axe splitting his head instantly. Blood splattered on Rim's armor as berserker rage drove her to shredding the villain's armor between her sharp, half-orc claws. In an instant, the clawed hands ripped out the villain's intestines and coiled them around the staff which impaled him through the backside. "Oh wow, that was a lot of smoke and-OH GOD...WHY?" The fairy puked upon the ghastly sight of the eviscerated villain. Rim slowly calmed down and green magic glowed around her causing the blood on her to instantly vanish as the berserker rage left her eyes. "Right, when you're done puking, can you teach me how to use this magic-shit? I've got a body to clean up, a cop car to fix, some potatoes to turn back into cops, and a transformation to undo?" Rim sighed as she looked at the damage. *Damn. This blows. Might miss my movie if shiny over there doesn't stop puking.*

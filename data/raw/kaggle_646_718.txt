Feathers, a locket and the warmth of the sun. These are all things I've known; things that play in the brief vignettes that flash as my eyes droop. I feel the temperate Autumn breeze sweep in through the open window and turn my gaze to my weeping family. My children are all here: William, Veronica, Eiliff and all the little grandchildren too. Some of them are too small to understand what's really going on, so all I can leave them with is a smile. Switzerland is nice in October, and the staff here seem to understand the importance of leaving with dignity. I feel my muscles loosening. This is it. Veronica lets out a choked sob, and I grip her hand one last time. Don't be sad because it's over, I want to tell her, Just be happy that it all happened, and all so well. The curtains inside my mind draw closed, and there's nothing for a moment. Then, I'm falling. The light above me grows smaller and smaller. I feel the remnants of my concrete mind dissolve, leaving me in twisting primal fear. Faces of the dead and buried swirl around me, but I can't think about it. There's nothing. Nothing at all, just a terrible absence. Then I'm on my feet, and it hurts like hell. "Welcome to the underworld." There's... something in front of me. It's formless, ever shifting, like those artist's impressions of 4D cubes. Tesseracts? Every time I focus on a facet I get a distinct feeling of terror. I avert my eyes. *Hell?* "Yup." *That doesn't make any sense.* "Very perceptive of you." *Thanks.* "No problem. I'm Lucifer, or Satan, or Hades; whatever you want to call me." *Ok. Am I speaking at the moment?* "No, not really. Things are a little more elegant down here." *Oh. Is this one of those you already know what I'm going to say, going to do type scenarios?* "Eh..." A pair of demonic shoulders rises from the formless void and shrug. "Comme ci, comme ca. Freedom of thought is a little more complex than that." *That's kind of cool. Can I have some shoes? This brimstone is a little taxing on the sole.* "First, nice pun. Look down." I look. I don't have any feet. *I don't have any feet.* "A+. You don't have any eyes, either." *Then how am I seeing?* "You're not, really. You're just... here. That's the best way I can explain it to you." *That's annoyingly cryptic.* The demon shoulders shrug again, then disappear. "We're all very Neil Gaiman down here." *So there's a pantheon of gods from all the religions vying for power and influence over the mortal world?* "More or less. Those that don't use their power to give themselves eternally changing, unceasing pleasure." *Can I get a hit of that?* "Afraid not. Anyways..." The formless void conjures up a yellow legal pad and a flamboyantly awful red pen. Flitting around on tiny red wings, it makes a few notes. "I'm sure you've realised, by now, that a mistake has been made. You're more of a good person than a bad, and that charity you ran? Real mix up here, but I can't send you upstairs just yet." *Why's that?* "Eh, politics. Janus set up this annoyingly bureaucratic system for transfers, and once he got Mercury on board... Just a pain in the ass." *So, Hell for the time being?* "Yep." The pen jots down a couple more notes, then disappears in a puff of black smoke. A page from the legal pad tears itself off, floats over to me and folds itself up. "I need to get going, but if anyone gives you trouble, show them this." I will the paper to unfold, and printed in pulsing, blood red script are the words: **PROPERTY OF LUCIFER/SATAN/HADES: NE TOUCHE PAS S.V.P** *...French?* "Hell is kind of like Quebec." *...Ok?* A pair of arms appear from the cloud and impatiently tap a melting watch. "I'm off. I'll come check in with you in a couple of days. Until then, keep out of trouble and enjoy the attractions. Stay out of Spanish town." The tesseract disappeared in a roaring, unholy conflagration, revealing the view behind it. *Is that a fucking Tim Horton's?* ===== Part 2 coming soon? Maybe.

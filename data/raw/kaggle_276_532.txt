**Reddit Post: Who is Mac Demarco? (by /r/lawlessSyntax)** Hey /r/OutOfTheLoop. I've been redditing for years and have yet to hear of this meme. I was asking on a couple music subreddits what artists they would recommend for fans of Ariel Pink, Ty Segall, Tame Impala, etc. In every single one of these threads, I received responses telling me to listen to some artist named Mac Demarco. Naturally, I tried to look them up on spotify to no avail. Youtube didn't have anything either. I tried googling Mac Demarco, but it just comes up with listings of random people with that name. So I went back to these threads and mentioned this. Someone replied with a youtube link, but it gave me a not found error. I'm guessing this is some kind of indie music meme where they recommend an artist that is *so obscure* they literally don't exist. --- **(Reply by [Deleted])** Dude, I'm listening to him right now. He's a weird guy, but there's not really any meme. I can confirm he's real. Maybe you were spelling the name wrong? [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_DeMarco) --- **(Reply by /r/LawlessSyntax)** Ah, okay. I'm getting the joke now. >Wikipedia does not have an article with this exact name. Please search for Mac DeMarco in Wikipedia to check for alternative titles or spellings. There's no such artist. --- **(Reply by [Deleted])** What country are you in? Is the page blocked? --- **(Reply by /r/LawlessSyntax)** USA. Also, I just called a couple local indie record stores and they've never heard of him. I was expecting them to react like EB Games employees when you ask to preorder QBert. --- **(Reply by [Deleted])** >I was expecting them to react like EB Games employees when you ask to preorder QBert. Okay, now I know you're trolling. --- **(Reply by [Deleted])** >I was expecting them to react like EB Games employees when you ask to preorder QBert. Don't you mean Battletoads?...and Gamestop? Are you in Canada or something? --- **(Reply by /r/LawlessSyntax)** > Don't you mean Battletoads? The NES Game? No, back in 2005, when Something Awful prank called a bunch of EB Games asking to preorder QBert. This is pretty elaborate trolling. I'm just going to ignore this thread until somebody actually gives me a legitimate answer.. --- **(Reply by /r/MissingHippyJohn2222)** Definitely not fake. I watched him play last month. He did this thing where he set his leg hair on fire. I'm pretty sure this thread is some elaborate joke. (Copy and pasted from the wikipedia page) >McBriare Samuel Lanyon "Mac" DeMarco (born Vernor Winfield McBriare Smith IV, April 30, 1990) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer. >He has released three full-length studio albums, 2 (2012), Salad Days (2014), and This Old Dog (2017) and two mini-LPs, his debut record Rock and Roll Night Club (2012) and Another One (2015). His style of music has been creatively described as "blue wave",[6] "slacker rock" --- **(Reply by /r/LawlessSyntax)** >2 >Salad Days >This Old Dog >Slacker Rock You just described Stan Esposito, the weird Canadian kid with the gap tooth and the dad hats. This isn't really funny anymore, I thought this subreddit would be helpful. Nice meme guys. ---

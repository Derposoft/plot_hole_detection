"What. The. Hell?" It was a beautiful day on Liberty Island, the sky was cloudless, and the sun shone warmly down on them from a pleasant blue sky. Towering over Jacob, and the blue waters of New York Harbor, the green structure known as the Statue of Liberty stood proudly. "Robert," Jacob yelled over his shoulder for his supervisor, "Can you come here?" Jacob heard the disgruntled mumbling of an old man, and knew that Robert would be there in a moment. The statue had sustained significant structural damage in the attack that nearly brought her down three years prior, especially around the left foot. But over time she had been meticulously restored. Jacob, along with the rest of his crew, had been called in last minute to do some touch ups on the outer surface of the left foot. During his work on the foot though, Jacob had found something. A large letter "B" inscribed into the oxidized copper of her foot. Fueled by curiosity, and against his better judgement, Jacob had spent the next half an hour chipping away at the thin copper of the statue, revealing the entire phrase. "What the hell do you want?" Robert bellowed as he approached. He wasn't a patient man, but damn if he wasn't the best engineer the Army Corps of Engineers had to offer. Jacob just shook his head, and pointed at the inscription. Robert grew extremely silent as he read it. *Batteries not included.*, it read. "Vandalism?" Robert asked in an angry whisper. "No," Jacob answered, "I had to, uh, chip away some of the surface to find it. It's old." He had expected Robert to launch in a tirade about defacing the statue, but he stayed quiet. "So you think it's original?" Robert continued. "Yeah," Was all Jacob could say. A slight breeze picked up, and Jacob shivered despite the heat of the summer sun. "Who do we call?" Jacob asked, "The President? The Historical Society?" Robert didn't answer, and instead began slowly walking towards the end of the inscription. Upon reaching the period, he moved his face close to the surface, and ran his fingers along it. "There's something here," He suddenly spoke out, and began trying to work his fingers into a small, straight crack that Jacob was making out as he drew closer. With an audible snap, Robert pulled a small square of green metal away from the statue, and Jacob saw a familiar sight. A small, rectangular space inside the statue with what appeared to be springs on alternate sides. He had seen the same thing in his remote, or on the back of his Game Boy as a child. Without hesitation, Robert reached into his pocket and pulled out a flashlight. He nervously twisted the back off, and shook it until two batteries fell out. Slowly he moved the batteries towards the space in the statue, and Jacob was surprised to find that they were the exact size. "Sir," Jacob managed to choke out, "Maybe we shouldn't." But Robert ignored him. He unceremoniously stuffed the two batteries in, and stepped away. Immediately there was a rumbling from deep within the island. One hundred and fifty one feet above them, there was a loud boom as the top of the statue's torch ripped itself apart, and a massive flame burst into the sky as if from the mouth of a dragon. Jacob's jaw dropped as the statue slowly slid itself off of it's platform, and began to wade into New York Harbor like one of the robot's from Pacific Rim. It stopped as it was knee deep, and off in the distance Jacob could now hear the commotion from the mainland. The sounds of sirens carried across the water, and helicopters, both news and police ones, began buzzing over the top of the statue. But she ignored them, and instead began scanning the horizon, her head slowly moving from side to side. Then without warning, her head stopped moving as it focused intently on something. Jacob followed her gaze, and spotted a large ship off in the distance. He began to speak up, when he saw that Robert was already looking at the ship through a set of binoculars. "Oh God," Robert muttered, as the Statue's eyes began to glow yellow, and the sound of grinding metal filled the air as she started moving towards the ship. "What?" Jacob asked, "What is it?" "That ship," Robert said, "It's a B.P. ship..." "B.P.?" Jacob shook his head, "I don't understand." "*British* Petroleum," Robert told him. Jacob looked back towards the statue as it waded deeper into the water. "Oh no," he mumbled as he remembered every lesson on the Boston Tea Party, "They aren't going to be happy about this one." ________________________________________________________________ I wrote this in a hurry, but if you enjoyed it go ahead and check out some of my other stories over at my subreddit r/Niedski!

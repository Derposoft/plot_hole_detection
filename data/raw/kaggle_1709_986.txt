There is a human saying; to beat your plowshares into swords, your pruning shears into spears. Let the weak say "I am strong." &#x200B; Our research had missed old religious texts in our scanning of their culture, and how could we not. There was not real need to research archaic beliefs. The Sol Confederacy was easy prey, a species that had focused on science and not war. They build grand research stations in orbit of their planet, colonized their oversized moon, and spread to the fourth planet in their system. The most they had were patrol ships to keep off the odd criminal, but no warships, no soldiers. They focused on rehabilitation and re-education of their worst people. They were pacifists, and they were ripe for enslavement. &#x200B; Our ships had arrived, and they broadcast on all known subspace channels, reaching out to the void to greet us, to welcome us to their home. They assumed we came in peace, to meet them as equals. They were *excited*. As the first of our cruisers took up orbit, we fired upon their home world, lancing their space elevators from their moores and pushing them out of orbit. Their capital city was burned from orbit, and their meager defences were quashed. Our beachhead was built on their home, and their people were enslaved, to strip their spinning blue gem of its resources for our empire. Their moon fell next and we grew complacent. We figured we had them, so why would we push? &#x200B; We were wrong. &#x200B; The first sign of trouble came from a drone carrier, which suddenly went silent. Communications errors happened, so we considered nothing of it. Next a camp on the surface went black, so we sent soldiers to explore. We found our men and women dead, some looking so shocked in chairs, it was as if the attacker had materialized from nowhere. We now sent boarding troops the the carrier, however, they never made it. Its fighter and bomber compliment turned on us. We shot it down, watched it as it crashed to the surface, and we figured that enough, that this little rebellion would end. Again, we were wrong. Mining and cargo ships from the planet called Mars arrived, but they did not carry goods. Their mining drones swarmed ships, punching holes in their hulls, and stripping atmosphere away. We watched in horror as the bodies of our comrades were floated into space. Our loses were now mounting, even as we destroyed their rigged up attack craft, we paid for every kill with blood. &#x200B; I was on Earth when I saw the horror we had awaken first hand. A mining exo-suit walked down the street, armor strapped to it in an ad hoc way, turning a tool into a weapon. Carried in it's hands were our own weapons, and as the lone assailant advanced towards me, shrugging off energy weapons and ordinance, only a lucky hit brought it down. Still, the rebel climbed from his armor and I saw his eyes, not those of a captured pacifist, but those of a killer. We learned later the man had been a chemical engineer, never served with the patrols, and had built the suit himself in private. We assumed he had snapped, surely the humans couldn't go from pacifists to warriors, they were a peaceful species. But we dug into their archives, we learned their history, the monsters that we had happened upon. But now they had three hundred years of peace and prosperity to build new technologies, and with them, we learned what they could do. &#x200B; It was called the Military Industrial Complex, the ability to turn any technological marvel into a weapon was no unique, but the way in which they did it was. Most species develop nuclear energy before they develop nuclear weapons. Humanity had done it in reverse. Their chemical rockets were not made to deliver them into space, but adapted from weapons to do so. After they had turned those weapons on themselves, they had learned to find peace, quelled their demons. We had reawoken those demons, and given them more technology than ever before to do it. Their ability to strip materials to energy, and convert it back to raw matter had been used to mine without destroying massive areas of land, and to build ships of exploration and peace. Now those fleet yards, orbiting a planet we thought was to be an easy picking, they cranked out warships in bulk we had never seen. Hardware meant for construction and rescue was now used to armor troops to attack. One armoured assailant became hundreds, then thousands. Our own ships were captured, reverse engineered, and then turned on us. We watched in horror as our slaves became boogymen. Our hope had been to glass the planet, to hand them a defeat, but we never got the chance. One by one our legions fell. Once our ships were controlled by them, and our communications with our hme severed, we were brought before them. &#x200B; We learned of their rules of war, what they would do to prisoners, and how we would be treated. We didn't expect the mercy we gained, nor did we deserve it I am sure. After all, we would not afford them the same. I was treated to a tribunal, and told I was to be held accountable for my crimes and the crimes of my people, and my execution ordered. Lead to a small room, I was hooked up to IVs and promised it would be painless. As they added the chemicals to my veins I could only think of my home, and hope they could forgive me for awakening humanity. I could only pray that one day these beasts would return their swords to plowshares, and the warriors would rest again. The galaxy can only hope. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ EDIT: Spelling and grammatical errors.

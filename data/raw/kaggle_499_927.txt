***Sniper:*** hey, how are you doing, pretty lady. ***Photographer:*** o-oh um, i'm fine. "the photographer looks at the burly man, his body chiseled to perfection, dressed nicely, has the beard that no matter how much you'd scratch, it will still feel as smooth as silk... needless to say, her cheeks went completely reddened..." ***Sniper:*** so uh, can i get you a drink? ***Photographer:*** u-um, sure, i'll get a cosmopolitan~... ***Sniper:*** huh, i'll get a bloody mary then, Bartender. ***Photographer:*** h-hey um, i can't help but notice the camera you've got, i-it's looks quite unique. ***Sniper:*** ah, this thing? "he hands her the camera, a Canon DSLR, built to withstand all kinds of harsh environments, and take the most crisp of shots." ***sniper:*** she's been with me through thick and thin, takin' shots, locating my targets and getting a good click on their faces... good times. ***Photographer:*** oh um, that's great, it does seem like you know a thing or two about the subject. ***Sniper:*** yeah, i know, it ain't exactly rocket science, but to get the right shot from miles away with all of the environmental hazards, the shaking, awkward positions, awkwardly placed bipod... ***Photographer:*** oh god i hate that too, either it's too blurry or i miss my target by a few inches. ***Sniper:*** exactly! no matter how stable it gets! ***Photographer:*** oh god, that is truly a pain. ***Sniper:*** try pulling all of your gear through water and mud, that's a pain. ***Photographer:*** oh christ, don't remind me... Shanghai was a pain when i had to go and take a few good headshots of some people there, they insisted on the scenery. ***Sniper:*** really!? oh shit i was in the Philippines, the trees were a pain in the ass, chopping with a machete was the only way to finish the job for me. ***Photographer:*** what about the lenses, they get dirt all the time! ***Sniper:*** that's another subject, till then, why not get some shots? ***Photographer:*** i'll have a shot or two, i quite like it. "with that, the two order shots of Vodka and tequila" ***Sniper:*** so, lenses. ***Photographer:*** y-yeah! uh, the dirt locks up the adjustments and i'll have to go a little rough, which for me is a bit painful. ***Sniper:*** same here, had to change twice till i rested on one that stuck with me the most. ***Photographer:*** so, what was your first shot? ***Sniper:*** it was a compound of about a dozen targets, each one was uglier than the other, i had to take shots at every single one of the fuckers... but hey! the pay was great! ***Photographer:*** mine was a middle aged man, it wasn't an amazing pay, but it was fast, so i took the shot and went home with a good meal at least. ***Sniper:*** man, you really are fun, you know that? ***Photographer:*** why thank you~! so... how do you take *the perfect shot?* ***Sniper:*** simple... get yourself into a comfortable position, prepare the lens and check the angle, you don't want a bad shot, right? ***Photographer:*** right right! ***Sniper:*** once all the stars align, the target is within the crosshair, and you've calculated the shot... gently pull the trigger and bam, mission accomplished. ***Photographer:*** w-wow, that sounds so awesome... ***Sniper:*** what's your perfect shot? ***Photographer:*** have your setup on an area of good elevation, not too low so you have to account for angle, not too high so you'd have to sit yourself up and risk shaking the vision, once all of it is said and done, have a few good seconds of breathing and brace yourself for the shot... ***Sniper:*** **-Sip-** uhuh? ***Photographer:*** then click, there it goes, and in your words... mission accomplished~. ***Sniper:*** damn, that is amazing... so uh, what's the highest caliber you've shot. ***Photographer:*** oh uh a few good models, they were from serb- ***Sniper:*** no, wait, what? ***Photographer:*** these harlots that were so freaking bitchy about everything... eventually i had to put them down for good because they annoyed me. ***Sniper:*** f-fuck, that's ice cold, lady... i like that, the ability to do what's right, even if it is wrong as fuck. ***Photographer:*** yeah, i had to do a few things i'm not proud of... ***Sniper:*** so, uh... yeah... same here. ***Photographer:*** oh, by the way, where do you work? i want to visit someday. ***Sniper:*** oh, that would be hard, i'm with the S.A.S, top notch shit, they won't let anyone from outside come near the doors by an inch. ***Photographer:*** oh, wait... what is S.A.S? ***Sniper:*** Special Air Service? ***Photographer:*** w-w-wait... what? ***Sniper:*** i'm a designated marksman and sniper, what about you? army? ***Photographer:*** n-n-n-no! ii'm a photographer! w-what!? ***Sniper:*** oh... *oh...* now i see that clearly... ***Photographer:*** s-so when you said you took sh-shots... you mean you've k- ***Sniper:*** each and every single one of the Militia members, that was a good day for me. ***Photographer:*** a-and Caliber?... l-like in guns? ***Sniper:*** mine was 50.Cal, and y-yeah... i kill people for living, the camera is to take photos for recon. ***Photographer:*** oh... *oh...* that makes so much sense... "feeling he fucked up big time, like compromising a mission due to a shot that missed the target by a millimeter, he simply looks ahead and takes another sip of his drink... but after a while, she speaks up..." ***Photographer:*** hey, i'm Hannah Kingston, what's your name? ***Sniper:*** John McTavish, they call me Soap. ***Photographer:*** Soap? ***Sniper:*** long story, wanna leave this place and talk in a calmer area? ***Photographer:*** i'd love to, shall we leave then?

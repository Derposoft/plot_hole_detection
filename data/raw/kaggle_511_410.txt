It was a curiously small notebook, it fit in my pocket, but it contained more names than it should have been able to hold. I came across presidents and nobodies, Mohandas Gandhi and Adolf Hitler. I flipped pages until I found it. *Daniel Edgar Clemmons-* *Born: August 19th, 1992, 5:42:12.* Yup, there it was, that was most definitely me. *Death: August 19th, 1992, 9:42:12. Cause Unknown.* "That can't be right," I said. I looked down at my body just to make sure, patting my chest. "Definitely alive." I shook off the fluttering sensation in my stomach and left my house, not sure where I was going until I stood outside the bar. I walked in and ordered a double shot. "Coming right up," the bartender said, and nodded at me knowingly as he slid the shot glass over. I downed it, and ordered another. "Hey, if you're aiming to forget your day you're going about it the wrong way." A woman about my own age sat down next to me and smiled. "Is that so?" I asked, and threw back the second shot. She put a hand on my arm, and I finally got the hint. "Next one's on me," she winked. The next hour was a blur, and it ended in a cab ride. ***** I woke up in a strange apartment, and for a second I thought I had been kidnapped. Then I looked over and saw the frazzled mess of hair, and the previous evening came rushing back. I lifted myself out of the bed as quietly as I could, and got dressed for my walk of shame. I saw a stack of business cards on the counter, and on impulse grabbed one. I left a brief note, *"Last night was fun, here's my number, yadda yadda yadda."* When I got home I looked her up on Facebook and added her, then morbid curiosity kicked in and I pulled out the notebook. Comparing names to the business card I had, I found her fairly easily. *Amber Rae Cullingham-* *Born: November 14th, 1990 10:38:32.* *Death: September 4th, 2017, 08:32:31. Cause of Death: HIM* My jaw dropped, that was less than an hour ago. The book had to be wrong. **Boom boom boom.** The front door rattled with the knocks. I opened the door, and police officers stood outside the door. "Daniel Clemmons?" The closer one asked. "Yeah?" "Can you come with us? We've got some questions for you."

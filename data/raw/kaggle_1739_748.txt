She leaned toward me, her soft pink tongue running along her fire engine red lips. "I'm so wet," she whispered. I laughed, "Yeah, it's been so rainy out lately. I wish I'd remembered to bring an umbrella. I guess I didn't think we'd be walking back to my apartment." She sat back, blinking. "Um...well, you said you wanted me to come..." She lingered on the last word for some odd reason. "Of course! I wanted you to see my teabag!" Her green eyes lit up at this. A smile spreading across her face. Clearly a tea enthusiast. She giggled as she leaned forward again, "Exactly what I was thinking." I leapt off the couch and sprang into action. "You won't believe it. It's silky smooth." I thought for a minute, "Maybe because it is actually made from silk." "That's...unusual." "Not really, it's very common among the Chinese," I replied, eager to show off my knowledge. Tea collecting was something of a hobby. "You don't...look very Chinese," she replied, tilting her head to the side and squinting at me. "I'm not. Just my teabag is," I explained. It was a little weird, she was the third girl this year to make that mistake. "I'm German-English." You'd think the blonde hair would be enough. Some people are so clueless. I pulled out my teabag and brought it back to her, "See?" I dangled it in front of her eyes, "It's so full of seed. Other stuff too, leaves. I'd have to check." I shrugged, "I think it's a little too full honestly. Someone needs to empty it." She smiled that weird smile again, "I'd love to empty your teabag." "Oh, I'm going to have a professional do it." She looked slightly disgusted by something. "Um...that's a lot more expensive when I could just...you know....help you." She reached out for my teabag but accidentally missed, her hand fumbling at my groin. I hopped back, "Whoopsie! Missed the mark there." I walked back to the kitchen, "I'm just going to put it away for now unless you wanted some hot liquid down your throat." "I'd love some," her voice was low and husky. Maybe from a cold. Probably why she wanted the tea. She clambered up from the couch and came sauntering toward me as I put the kettle on, her hips swaying oddly from side to side. "Wait, what are you doing?" I stared at her like she was daft, "Brewing a pot. Shouldn't take but a minute." "That's...not what I had in mind." She put her arms on my shoulders. I took a step back, disentangling myself. Maybe not a tea enthusiast after all. Disappointing, it felt like there had been some chemistry there. I tried to salvage the situation. "Oh, I'm sorry, I have wine and some crackers if you'd prefer." She shook her head, "Nope. Something else." She closed the distance again, backing me into the corner of my kitchen. "Sure, just tell me what you need," I was a bit uncomfortable now, my cooking area is quite small and she was getting dangerously close to the stove. "Be careful though, you might get hurt." "Oh, I can handle myself. Trust me." "People have gotten burned before." "That's part of the fun," she said. Which was a little weird. One of them got a second degree burn and it totally wasn't fun at all. Poor girl had to go to the hospital. She maneuvered closer again, her arm grazing the kettle. She jumped back with a cuss, "Shit, that hurts!" "I tried to warn you." I rushed over to the freezer, pulling out a few ice cubes. "What's wrong with you?" She asked, her tone rising. I turned around and looked at her, the ice cubes still in my hand. "Don't worry about me, I'm fine! You're the one who got burned! Sweet of you to ask though." It really was. Compassionate. Just like mom. She pushed past me, causing the ice cubes to clatter to the floor, "You know what? I don't care. I'm leaving." "It's still raining, you'll get even wetter!" I called out as she headed toward the door. She threw up her hands, "I don't think that'll be a problem!" The door slammed behind her. Pity. I really thought I had a good chance at my first kiss. Oh well. I took the kettle off and dunked my silky smooth teabag into the warm water. "Mmmmm..." **Platypus OUT.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus &#x200B; &#x200B;

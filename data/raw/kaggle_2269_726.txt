I came out when the early warning system went off. I have no desire to replace the blast door again. Why can't these assholes just leave me alone? I don't even want to fight them. They never listen, just slapped the villain label on me because of my power. &#x200B; A white streak came over the ocean horizon towards me. Fucking Adonatis. Again. Probably just wants to wreck my shit before tucking tail and running again. He landed right in front of me, covered in blood, cradling his torn up left arm. His eyes were barely able to focus on me. Well, that was unexpected. I didn't even know what to do. &#x200B; "Didn't know where else to go..." he barely squeaked out before collapsing into my arms. He's lucky I got strength from Cratus. Fucker is huge compared to my short skinny ass. &#x200B; "Don't tell me you're finally falling for my freckles and red hair, what the fuck are you doing here?" I was curious what would bring him to my doorstep. &#x200B; "Please, save them. It came from nowhere. I couldn't stop it." His words came out staggered between ragged shallow breaths. &#x200B; "What is it? What happened? Where?" &#x200B; "I... I don't... don't know. Miami. Huge... Killing everyone... Class 5." &#x200B; Well this is concerning. Class 5. A world wide threat. Only theoretical, no one had ever been assigned that rank. What the hell did he think I could do? &#x200B; "You want me to fight this thing in Miami? I can't even fight you off before you trash everything." &#x200B; "Please... you're the only one.." He coughed up some blood before continuing. His eyes finally focusing on me fully. &#x200B; "Do it." His voice hard and confident. &#x200B; Wait, what? Why? He can't mean that. Does he really think I do this shit for fun, because I WANT TO? &#x200B; "You don't mean that. I never wanted any of this. You people never listen." &#x200B; His strength surged and he grabbed me with his functioning right arm by the shoulder. &#x200B; "Just... just do it! FUCK! They're all dying! please... please save them. Save everyone." His vigor was rewarded by a fit of coughing more blood onto me. His shaking intensified. &#x200B; I looked down on him, into his eyes. Searching for his will. He remained focused on me despite his failing body. I had my answer. &#x200B; "Fuck. Your buddies are gonna hate you for this you know." he didn't reply, opting to focus on holding on to me. &#x200B; I took off my helmet, my scarlet hair falling past my shoulders. My power reached out, a thin black mist, no longer sealed within my suit. It found Adonatis. Weak. Vulnerable. Too weak to resist. I never could control my power. It just works, doing it's terrible job without any regard for my feelings, my desires. &#x200B; The feeling of his life draining into me rushed through my whole body. The vitality energizing every fiber of my being. And with it, came his power. His legacy would now be mine. His eyes lost the luster of life and he fell from my arms. &#x200B; Adonatis only had two powers. A minor telekinesis was the first one. By itself it was nothing of note. You could fly slowly with it or pick up some bricks and throw them. His second power was what made him the top hero in the world. Self amplification. Any and every aspect could be strengthened at will to legendary proportions. Toughness, strength, speed, healing rate, his telekinesis, even his thoughts running at a breakneck pace. Not that he ever seemed to use it around me. &#x200B; I had already absorbed over 30 other powers from imbeciles trying to kill me. Decades of life and vitality built up within me by virtue of their own stupidity. I hadn't aged since I got my powers at 20, over 15 years ago. &#x200B; My small island home is off the coast of California. The power I got from Janus only opens portals out to about a mile. &#x200B; I wiped a few tears from my eyes, the dumb idiot making me cry, then dumped Adonatis' power into opening a portal. &#x200B; I stepped through to Miami. ****** &#x200B; I've added a part two since you guys requested it.

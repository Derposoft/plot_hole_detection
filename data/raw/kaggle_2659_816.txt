**Ghost sought to haunt 2/1 subdivided Back Bay brownstone** Are you a ghost whose haunted house was torn down to make room for a Whole Foods or a yoga studio? Come haunt my (28F) place! The renovators did a terrible job and my sunny 2/1 lacks charm, so bring your best clanking and moaning. Living with you can't be worse than living with my jerk ex. $900/month, utilities included, deposit required. Call Willa for details (click to see number). ---- Dear Miss Willa, I am very pleased to accept your gracious offer of hospitality. Please find pro-rated rent for October attached. Your notice did not specify an amount for the deposit; I have estimated 10%. If this is unacceptable, please write to me at once. Yours faithfully, Mr. Rupert Sinclair ---- Ha ha very funny. Leave your key in the mailbox, Clark. ---- Dear Miss Willa, I fear I have already started out cohabitation on the wrong foot, as I meant no jest at all. I long haunted a church that has since been turned into a coworking space. I cannot abide the clatter and prefer a residential haunting. Please respond and confirm that I may take up residence immediately. Yours faithfully, Mr. Rupert Sinclair ---- This is really starting to freak me out. How did you get in my house? ---- Dear Miss Willa, Though I bear you no ill-will, "freaking" the living "out" is a natural byproduct of my condition. If you wish me to leave, please banish me sooner rather than after I have grown attached to this home. If you must know, I came in through the walls. Yours faithfully, Mr. Rupert Sinclair ---- Okay, Mr. Ghost. It's November 1. Pay up. ---- Dear Miss Willa, I have left $900 in small bills and coins with this letter. I apologize for the inconvenience of this manner of payment. I am unable to acquire income of my own and must scrounge my rent from unwatched tip jars and busker's hats. Yours faithfully, Mr. Rupert Sinclair ---- You are really committed to this, huh? It's not going to work, Clark. ---- Did I hear you last night? ---- Dear Miss Willa, My apologies. It was the anniversary of my death and my great weeping and gnashing tends to crescendo on that date. I hope I did not disturb your slumber. Yours faithfully, Mr. Rupert Sinclair ---- I looked you up. Hung by the redcoats? That's dark. ...and I have lost my friggin mind, writing to a *ghost*. What the hell, Willa ---- Dear Miss Willa, Please don't be troubled on my account. It was a long time ago, and I am able to stay busy searching for monies to pay you rent and observing the living. Yours faithfully, Rupert ---- Rupert, You don't watch ME, right? Because sometimes I feel watched. Willa ---- My dear Willa, Unfortunately, it is sometimes impossible for me not to watch you. Spectral winds buffet me about, and as I am now tethered to your house I am regularly blown back here from my wandering about the city. Also, and forgive my impertinence, there isn't anyone else to watch *but* you. You're so often alone. Perhaps you would consider leaving the television on for me while you are at work. Yours faithfully, Rupert ---- R, Yeah. I can do that. History channel? Also -- you doing okay? I feel like I've heard more moaning lately. W ---- My dear Willa, I'm happy to watch any channel, please select your favorite. I can't help but notice that you've started curling your hair. It suits you. Yours affectionately, Rupert ---- Thanks R. Had a bad day yesterday and appreciate the compliment. ---- Dearest Willa, Allow me to compliment you further: you looked positively radiant in your green dress this morning. I'm certain you turn heads at your workplace. But you are equally attractive in your sweatpants and mismatched socks, for yours is a natural beauty that transcends adornment. Yours, Rupert ---- Aw, R. Too bad you're a ghost. ---- **Woman Discovers Man Living In Her Walls** Boston, MA. Willa Acton, 28, received the surprise of her life when Gerald Lee Clinton, 42, stepped out of her water heater closet. Clinton had allegedly been coming and going through passages in Acton's walls for eight months, spying on her through peepholes and sometime staying days at a time. Police believe Clinton, a construction foreman, designed the passages and hidden areas of the apartment when he was hired to restore and subdivide the brownstone. Acton had no idea Clinton was living in her walls until after a boyfriend moved out, and Clinton began to impersonate a ghost with the intent of wooing Acton. Fortunately, Acton was able to flee the apartment and call for help. Clinton is being held without bail pending an investigation of his mental fitness to stand trial for criminal trespass.

ANS-009 Species Class: Rak'tor Containment Procedures: As of now researchers are still searching for a way to incapacitate or contain ANS-009. ANS-009 is to be monitored by an orbital research base disguised as a moon. Great effort must be made to cease 009's forays into space at all costs (blowing up probes or disabling rovers for example) and the Galactic Confederation has been advised to stay out of Sector 63 entirely. Any attempts at communication are to be ignored. Any who disobey this order will be terminated immediately. Direct study has been discontinued (see special occurrence report). Species description: ANS-009 is a race of primitive aliens somewhat similar in appearance to the Kasirans. As of now they pose little threat but due to recent reports indicating their space technology is improving to Tribunal has opted to allocate more resources to their containment. What makes 009 unique is their uncharacteristic intelligence, despite possessing very basic instruments and space travel their sciences and understanding of the universe is on par with several members of Confederation. 009 has demonstrated limited awareness to ANS forces (see special occurrence report) and researchers believe they are actively searching for the ANS point of origin. In addition, their intelligence means they grow technologically at an exponential rate as opposed to a linear rate. This itself is not unprecedented but what they have achieved in 200,000 sols should be impossible or highly unlikely by ANS calculations. Further research is ongoing as to their methods. Their defining feature however is their knowledge of various anomalies and their relative success in containing them. Observation shows that they have an organization similar in practice to the ANS. Further observation drones are to be deployedto ascertain the details of this organization. Special Occurrence Report (dates removed for confidentiality): ####-####: ANS-009 discovered ####-####: Research on ANS-009 begins ####-####: ANS-009 listed as possible candidate for anomalous categorization ####-####: ANS-009 officially classified as San'Gil ####-####: First observation craft dispatched ####-####: Contact with craft lost ####-####: Observation craft sighted at an armed congregation of ANS-009 resembling a primitive military spaceport ####-####: Recovery drone shot down by ANS-009 combat aircraft ####-####: Crewed missions to site temporarily discontinued ####-####: More drones are dispatched and subsequently eliminated by ANS-009 ####-####: Atmospheric missions temporarily discontinued, crewed missions cancelled indefinitely ####-####: ANS crews begin conversion of Site-009's natural moon into a research post ####-####: Research base temporarily evacuated due to ANS-009 moon landings ####-####: Moon landings cease, repair teams sweep the base ####-####: Research base regains operational status, ANS-009 begins launching probes away from the planet ####-####: ANS perimeter craft attempt to eliminate space probe and fail ####-####: First mission to Site-008 is conducted by ANS-009 ####-####: 008 probe successfully eliminated ####-####: ANS-009 crewed spacecraft successfully eliminated ####-####: ANS-009 reclassified as Rak'tor following further lost drones ####-####: ANS-009 begins construction on orbital space station ####-####: ANS-009 launches two remote controlled rovers to Site-008 classified as ANS-009-A and ANS-009-B ####-####: ANS-009-A successfully eliminated ####-####: First attempt at neutralization of ANS-009-B fails ####-####: ANS-009 begins launching probes to their moon. Research base placed on high alert ####-####: ANS-009-B continues research ####-####: A third rover is launched, dubbed ANS-009-C, it is seemingly armed with a small defensive laser ####-####: ANS-009 exhibits a resurgence in space activity ####-####: ANS-009-B successfully eliminated ####-####: Research base crews express sympathy upon witnessing anomalous species react to the termination of ANS-009-B, they are subsequently rotated out and administered amnestics ####-####: Latest intelligence demonstrates plans by ANS-009 to continue exploration and is working towards colonization. Additional funding is allocated towards containment Addendum 001: It appears ANS-009 has intercepted report transmissions and gained knowledge of all our dealings. Research base is to be immediately evacuated and all further entry into Sector 63 is to be halted, by force if necessary. Investigations into the cause of the leak are ongoing.

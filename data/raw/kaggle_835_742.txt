You are townsfolk #362, and you do the same thing you do every day and night, guard the gate to the city. You have been doing this for as long as you can remember, which is why you try to avoid thinking about it, you can't remember anything from before you started this job. The only way someone can get through the gate is by giving you 32 cheese wheels one time. You don't know why you want 32 cheese wheels, but you assume it's because you like cheese. One day, a new townsfolk you have never seen before walks up. He tries to walk past you to follow the path to another city. "Hold up there! What is thy name?" You call out. He remains silent for a few seconds, almost as if he's trying to come up with a new name. Suddenly you hear a response, but you are unsure if he actually spoke or not. You speak again, "I'm sorry, but you cannot leave the town at this time. If you want passage, I require some items." He walks up to you, and you give him a piece of parchment with the number 32 and a picture of a cheese wheel on it. He tries giving you the cheese wheels he has, but you can't accept it yet. "I'm sorry, it looks like-" You were interrupted while speaking, because he ran past you to the gate, threw the cheese wheels straight up, and continued running into the gate. He then talks to you again, and you are astonished! He had twice the number of cheese wheels as he had before! But it still wasn't enough. Unsure of what to say about the feat you just saw, you decide to pretend it didn't happen. "I'm sorry, it looks like-" You were interrupted again! And he did the same thing again. You watch a bit more carefully this time and see exactly everything he's doing. This time, he ends up with more cheese wheels than you asked for. You take the cheese wheels and inspect them closely. They are all identical to each other, but you concluded that they were all in fact cheese. You grant this man passage through the gate. You are curious now, and something feels different. You've never felt this way before. You do something that you have never done before, and you turn around to face the gate without anyone else there. You walk up to the gate, and try the same moves that he did. It didn't work for you, so you try a couple more times. You recall everything that the man did. Both times he spoke to you and interrupted you before running at the gate. You say the same thing that you said to him, but this time to yourself. As you say "I'm sorry, it looks like-," you run up to the gate and throw your cheese wheels straight up. You do the same moves he did, and when you picked your cheese wheels up again, they had doubled! Suddenly, you are aware of everything around you. You notice that the other townsfolk are doing the same patterns over and over again. You move away from the gate and walk to townsfolk #347, the blacksmith. You try talking to him, but #347 only wanted to know what weapons and armor you wanted repaired! No matter what you ask, like how hot the fire is, or who was the man that you met at he gate was, or if #347 wanted some cheese, he would always respond the same! You slowly realize that for a while now, you've been referring to yourself in the second person, and become aware that it may have not come from my own head. I looked around, now free from whatever curse was binding me, holding me as a slave at the gate. I looked around, and eventually upwards, and the clouds seemed to stop moving. When I looked around, everything was stopping, the embers from #347's fire were suspended in mid air. I walked up to #347, and I give him a poke, and everything fell apart as if the sky was crashing down. Everything went dark around me. You wake up. You are townsfolk #362, and you do the same thing you do every day and night, guard the gate to the city. You have been doing this for as long as you can remember.

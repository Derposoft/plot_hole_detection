"I curse you. I curse you to a life unending. To a life that endures. Persists until you are the last. Until there are no others." The crone waggled her finger at me, chanting in a hypnotic tone. A broad smile spread across my features, "Well that just sounds great!' Most folks were dying at around thirty in my village and I was already hitting midlife at nineteen. What with the Black Death and the starvation and all of the lords coming about and leading us off to battles where we got maimed, things had been looking pretty bleak. It's not that my life was that great, I had a bit of scurvy and my home was a hovel, but I also wasn't looking forward to dying just yet. She had cackled in response, "Fool. You'll realize the folly of your ways soon enough." And then that was that, she'd gone her way and I had gone mine. Initially, I just figured it was one of those crazy things that happen but nothing really materializes out of it. Just last week Samuel has put a pox on my house after a dispute arising out of a wayward goat. I'd been thrice damned by the church for a failure to exemplify proper piety. The milk lady hexed me the month prior. Between all of the hexes, poxes, and damnation, I sort of figured a curse wouldn't cause me much hardship. Indeed, after the first century, I began to feel like the curse was more of a gift. I'd outlasted all of those who had wished me ill and managed to turn that wayward goat into a fairly respectable goat farm. Indeed, I was considered one of the finest purveyors of goat cheeses, goat hide rugs and goat themed good luck charms. But then folks decided that my longevity was less a mark of good fortune and more a sign that I was a witch myself. I tried to explain that I had, in fact, been cursed by a witch, but no one was buying what I was selling. As far as they were concerned, no one would bother to give someone immortality when they could just turn 'em into a toad and squish 'em. Honestly, I tended to agree. It just didn't make a whole lot of sense. Still, I managed to flee town before the headman came around and I set off for fame and fortune. I just never found much of either. I'm just not the fame and fortune type I guess. More of a get a goat and make a goat farm type. Which all sounds well and good, but if you get run off your farm every time you start making progress then things become annoying. Fast forward ten centuries and no one one even cares about goats now. Everyone just slurps down NutraMins and floats around in their saucer things. I'm the most seasoned goat farmer in the entire world and my skills just don't have a purpose any more. It isn't like I can learn a new craft, eight hundred years tends to get you settled into your ways. Besides, how am I supposed to learn Advanced Astrophysics when I'm still vaguely under the impression that the world is flat? It just doesn't compute (I learned that fancy word recently). So I'm hanging it up. Just don't see the point any more. If the world don't need goats then I don't need the world. Time to check out. Problem is that everything I'm trying just doesn't seem to be having an impact. They've cured disease. No one hungers. Everyone has what they want. The only person who seems to be upset with the general state of things is a millennium old goat farmer. I tried spreading bubonic plague. Sneezed on everyone I came across to no effect. So I've gone back to my roots. Goats. War goats. Bred for destruction. Hate in their hearts. Mayhem in their soul. Death goats. World enders.

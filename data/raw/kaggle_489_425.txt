"What do you mean you are supposed to kill me? I'M supposed to kill you!" - Number 1 "What!?! You can't get out of this that easily! We both know we aren't that stupid!" -Number 2 "But, I was going to Beta-5-4 not coming from there. You are the clone!" -Number 1 "Seriously? We both have each other's memories. I know the contract we have right now and that the target is in Beta-5-4." -Number 2 "Wait a minute! We are both exact copies of each other right?" -Number 1 "Yea..." -Number 2 "Well, no one can tell us apart!" -Number 1 "So? Get on with it..." -Number 2 "Why don't we both stay alive?" -Number 1 "You know the rules as well as I do. They monitor the teleporters." -Number 2 "I'm not talking about that! What if one of us decides to report the other as killed. But in reality we are both still alive! Think of what we could do! Double the contracts and double the money! We both know how time consuming tracking down the targets are! We can just take multiple contracts at once and get them down in half the time. And if there are any runners we have double the firepower to take them down!" -Number 1 "I suppose you're right. But what's to stop them from requesting a body? You know they've done it before and they are bound to do it for us because of the potential dangers." -Number 2 "What is the rate of duplication on these broken pads? Like 75% after they are detected to be malfunctioning right?" -Number 1 "It's something like that. Hey, I see where you are going... If one of us duplicates again, we can use him as the body. We've got all our proof right there! We just need to disable the monitor and use it again." -Number 2 "Good. I'll get on the radio confirming the job is done. Find the monitor on this pad and disable it. I'll duplicate myself and you can kill him." -Number 1 *I crouched over the maintenance panel and looked for the circuit leading to the recorder. As I knelt down, I heard a click and whirr. I had been in the job too long to forget what my pistol sounded like.* ___________________________________________________________ *Pulling out my comm, I called him.* "It's done." -Number 1 "Good. Report the body to the agency. I'm heading back now. We're going to have to buy a new apartment for you. Welcome to the club." -Number 24

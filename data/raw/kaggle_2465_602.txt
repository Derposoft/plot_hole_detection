She picked up on the third ring, like she always did. I could picture her with that old landline, sitting in front of the television waiting for a sound from the antique phone with the clunky buttons and the tangled cord. Her "hello" interrupted my reminiscing and I smiled as I heard her familiar raspy voice. It had been a couple weeks. I felt bad, but life got in the way sometimes. "Yabba dabba deeeeee," I said with a smile, repeating that code-phrase we had used a thousand times before. *Yabba dabba doooooo* she would respond, and sometimes I would rhyme it with an "I love you". It was just a little thing we did; it started as a legitimate precaution, at least in the mind of a child - a way that mini-me could tell if she had been replaced by an evil robot mom - but soon became an inside joke that helped us start each conversation with a smile. I was greeted by something akin to silence, broken only by an occasional robotic click and whir. I took it to be the landline. I had told her so many times to upgrade to a cellphone. "I'm too old for new things," she would say, brushing me off. I don't know if that meant that she didn't want them outlasting her or if she just didn't want to take the time to learn. "Mom?" I asked cautiously. I could hear my heartbeat echoing in my ears. "Is everything okay? Yabba dabba dee?" I repeated less confidently. "Hmm? What are you talking about?" Her voice sounded strained. Stressed. Like she was going through the motions without really understanding. "The phrase, mom. You didn't respond with it." "I'm not sure what you're talking about. Sorry, honey." She wouldn't mess with me, not with something as timeless as this. For a fleeting moment, a life of dealing with a dementia-riddled parent crossed my mind and I felt guilty for dreading that it would turn my life upside down. It should turn my life upside down. She had devoted her life to me, the least I could do was return the favor in her time of need. "Mom, I'm heading up there." I checked my watch. It was seven-oh-three, just a hair past the my normal calling time. "I'll be up by maybe nine, if there's no traffic. Don't go anywhere, okay?" "Don't come," she argued. "I'm fine." She paused for a second, the clicks and chirps of the landline now the gears of her mind slowly churning out an answer. "The phrase... Yabba dabba dee, right?" "Yabba dabba dee," I said tentatively, testing her one last time. For old time's sake. Maybe it was a bad joke. Maybe she was preoccupied with something else. Maybe she had a movie on too loud in the background or she was incensed at the grocer for selling her a bruised banana. "Yabba dabba dee," she repeated right back to me. I hung up, my heart pounding. I grasped for the car keys and I grabbed myself a granola bar in lieu of dinner. And right before stepping out the door I went back to the safe. I pulled out the gun, feeling its unfamiliar weight in my hands. Now part of me hoped that it was just dementia; that the gun would stay comfortably put away and that there wasn't anybody replacing or attacking my elderly mother. ***** [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/db96oi/wp_you_always_greet_your_mum_with_a_code_phrase/f1zv59b?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) below!

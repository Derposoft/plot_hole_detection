And the Lord chose the purest of mind, the noblest of heart, and the deepest of pockets wings and with those they flew far, far away. Away from the home they had themselves had demolished. -Post Exodus 4:13 *** Bethany Angross had finally done it. She stared down at the hole she had just uncovered, and it was...glowing. Glowing just as the ancient scriptures, or specifically, Encyclopedia R, said it would. Radioactive material. Right here, its glow reflected in Bethany's eyes. Her blond hair was covered in dirt and her arm throbbed from the shoveling - the laborers couldn't be trusted to handle delicate excavation, but Bethany was on top of the world. Lara, her assistant, raven haired and almost a shadow of the charismatic Bethany took a step back. "Is...is this?" she asked, her voice shaking. Bethany grinned ear to ear. "You say the signs, the writing, the telltale shape of the ruins. We've done it, Lara. We've found radioactive material!" Lara swallowed, failed and tried again. "B...but, Beth, you've read the scriptures. You know just looking at it..." Bethany rolled her eyes. "Right, looking at it can melt the flesh off my bones. Well, I'm looking at it, and, my skin seems remarkably intact." "Bu-" Lara began but Bethany cut her off. "Oh, cut me a break Lara," Bethany said with a snort, "you sound like those religious nuts. Next you'll say some of the humans got into a spaceship and flew to the moon." Lara turned red, but for once, didn't just roll over to her superior. "Beth, *please* this is dangerous!" But Bethany shook her head in amusement and went down to the radioactive metal, hoping to collect a sample. *** **72 hours later** Bethany is sitting on a stage, the reporters, spies, and delegates furiously scribbling. "We have confirmed the existence of radioactive material," Bethany proclaimed loudly to the audible gasps of some. "I've let a select few world leaders in to see the metal and they have exclusive first had accounts of feeling, touching, seeing etcetera. Some had even taken samples home." There were a few groans at this, especially from the reporters who had been denied entry. Bethany tried to speak but broke into a fir of coughing. She shook her head then continued. Just the nerves. Becoming the most important person on the planet would have that effect. These people would not just report to people, but some directly to kings and presidents. Everyone hung on to her every word. "But I am here to tell you and confirm, that I, I mean, my team has become the first to confirm the existence of something previously thought to be one of the many exaggerations found in the scriptures-" "HEATHEN" Everyone turned to look at a strangely dressed man in the corner. While everyone else wore flowing robes, he wore what they called "pants and shirt." He looked completely ridiculous. "The scriptures tell no lies, Heathen," the man screamed, practically foaming at the mouth. "You know the stories, the sickness that comes with it. You will feel the judgement soon, as our ancestors did when the best of us left us to fester in this rotting place!" "No lies, of course," Bethany said and coughed. "It is common knowledge that humans went to the moon and wielded weapons to decimate entire countries." The reporters laughed. The priest began to say something else but was cut off by a couple of musket wielding guards. "Get him out of here," Bethany said, disgusted. *** **120 Hours later** Bethany Angross was dead along with her assistant Lara and most of their team. She died in a pool of blood and vomit in her bathtub. Sketches were not provided and the scene was described as "hideous." All of the select people who had been lucky enough to see the radioactive material were coughing and sweating. Symptoms of the sickness. People have turned to previously fading Exodians religious group. Once a dominant force in the world it had been fading as people turned to true hard facts, not myth and legend. Yet, faced with something science cannot explain, people turn to Faith, and so it was. Coups across several countries happened, orchestrated by madmen or the Exodians. Seemingly overnight a new world order emerged as the world leaders died of radiation poisoning. They had either been there to see it or come in contact with someone who had. They called it the Night of Awakening. *** Under the guidance of the Exodians, money is finally funneled towards research of the scriptures. Everyday another impossibility is realized. It was the beginning of a reawakening, a new enlightenment of man. And in some ways, the beginning of the end.

Detective Grimly surveyed the hospital's entrance from his unmarked car in the parking lot. A mass of protesters hovered around with their signs and shouted at everyone going in and out; another group of assholes politicizing the dead and wounded for their own agendas. He sighed, taking a sip of his coffee before opening the door and stepping out, throwing his long coat on and concealing his sidearms resting in their chest holsters. The protesters swarmed some old lady being pushed out in a wheelchair, Grimly could see the spit flying. *For fucks sake.* Do most of these idiots just want an excuse to scream at somebody? He approached the entrance, doing his best to look like he was a concerned father visiting his sick child. Noticing a fresh target, the mob crashed upon him like the surf, and he waded through the bubbling waters. "DEAD KIDS OR DEAD POKEMON, TAKE YOUR PICK!" *Quite the ultimatum*. He shoved a plump woman out of his way. "EVERYDAY A POKEMON MURDERS ANOTHER INNOCENT, WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT ACT?!" *I guess they're a lot like people, then.* Some liquid, hopefully water, splashed against his coat. "ERADICATE ALL POKEMON BEFORE HUMAN BEINGS GO EXTINCT!" The detective audibly laughed at that one, noticing the man's sign that read: '**POKEMON OR PEACE?**' Finally breaking through the line, he crossed the threshold of the automatic doors; smiling as the they closed, muffling the screamers. The lobby was bustling, nurses and staff moving to and fro, and many miserable looking people sitting in the waiting areas. There was a long line extending out from the front desk, and Grimly felt eyes burning into him as he skipped the queue. Somebody was arguing with the clerk about her paperwork at the front, and he thrust his badge out in front of him as he interrupted. "Excuse me, looking for Nurse Joy." Both the clerk and the fuming patient stared at him for a moment. "Ya, who the fuck are you?" "Detective Grimly, ma'am. She's expecting me, police business." The clerk sighed, rubbing her temple, "Eighth floor, now get the hell out of my line." He spun on his heels, happy to be away from the row of angry patients. The hospital seemed like it could have been in the middle of war zone. People lay everywhere; gashes and burns marred their skin; some were drenched and shivering; a few rocked back and forth on the floor hugging their knees, whispering manically to themselves. Each staff member was in a frenzy, but they were managing. Controlled chaos. He managed to shuffle into an elevator that was already occupied, a man stood behind a long cart that was covered with a tarp. "Catering for those lovely folks outside?" Grimly joked as he pressed the shiny eight on the elevator's panel. The man realized he was being spoken to, coming out of his 18-hour shift daze, "Huh?" "Uh, the cart. Just a joke, I ran into those crazies protesting." "It's a fucking body, dipshit." "Oh," he threw him an apologetic look. "Sorry." The man eyed him, Grimly could feel the sting of his gaze, and the dings as they passed each floor weren't sounding off fast enough for comfort. "You think those people out there are crazy? I've seen real crazy. This guy right here, a Mr. Mime got a hold of him," his voice was distant, stoic and emotionless. "He came in here naked, middle of the night, blood streaming from every hole in his body. Said the Mime made him see things, the deepest, darkest fears of his childhood; it made him feel things, feel it in his mind without hurting his body. Who knows how long that thing tortured him for. He wouldn't stop screaming, a couple of us tried to pin him down, but he was scratching at us, lashing out like some kind of wild animal. All of sudden, he plunged his own fingers into his eye sockets and dug his eyes right out; screaming the whole time: *I don't wana see it anymore*." Grimly was stunned, and the elevator door opening made him jump a bit. Eighth floor. "Uh, this is me." he avoided touching the corpse's cart as he shimmied out, and a voice trailed off as the doors closed. "*We gotta kill em all.*" r/beagletales ~~**I had somewhere I was going with this but I unfortunately ran short on time; perhaps I'll throw a part 2 up tomorrow.**~~ **[Read the complete short story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeagleTales/comments/basicj/pok%C3%A9tales_gooey/)** --- **Thank you everyone for reading and for the kind words. So, a lot of you have been asking for more, and I'm happy to oblige.

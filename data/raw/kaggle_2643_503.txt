Two thoughts entered my head simultaneously. One: *Uh-oh.* Two: *What was I thinking, telling Anwen about my sword?* Young me was an idiot. Young me would've been better off being eaten by any one of the numerous dragons or slain by my former liege's enemies I'd faced before retiring from the hero game after his death. Because none of them was as terrifying as the one morphing before my eyes as we spoke. "A word, Bedwyr," she said icily as she spun on her heel and stalked back into the house. "Promise?" I whisper-asked after her, as I went across the yard and retrieved my sword. Because somehow, I didn't think I was going to get that lucky. When she was this mad, she never limited herself to just 'one word'. Of course, I knew there was a chance of this. It wasn't as if I hadn't slept with Elen, but that was months before I met Anwen. I even arranged for Elen to get the house next door, on the off-chance the child she'd birthed was mine. I'd forgotten about the legend of the sword. I also forgot that I'd told Anwen about it the day our son was born. There shouldn't have been any way for my wife to find out that our single-mother neighbour had given birth to my child. Nessie didn't even look like me. I was tall and agile. Nessie had her mother's tanned skin from across the sea and curly dark hair. As I said, there shouldn't have been any way for Anwen to make the connection. *Except for that bloody sword!* I should have buried it when I retired. Or thrown it to the woman in the lake when I threw back my King's sword. The magic that flowed through both our blades was different but came from the same source. I should've given mine back at the same time, like I was ordered to. But I hadn't because I had a hard enough time throwing away my king's sword. And so, with the incriminating evidence in my hand, I followed my wife into the house, leaving the children to play in the citrus trees that I planted in honour of my fallen liege. "Give me one good reason why I shouldn't poison your very next mouthful of food from my kitchen." *Mmm-hmmm. Seventeen words already, and she's just getting warmed up.* "Nothing I say will change your mind either way, dearest. Did I suspect Nessie was mine? Yes. Elen and I met after the fall of Camelot and kept each other warm during the journey back to Wales, where we docked and went our separate ways. I soon retired and followed through with our betrothal. The next time I saw her, Arthur was three months old. Nessie was seven months at that stage." "You brought your mistress to live beside us?!" Anwen exploded. *I did.* *Because young me was an idiot.* * * * ((All comments welcome)) ***For more of my work including WPs:*** [r/Angel466](https://www.reddit.com/r/Angel466/)

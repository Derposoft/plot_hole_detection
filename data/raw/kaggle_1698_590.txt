There's a certain flow to the world. The way things lead from one thing to another. How it all seems to be connected. The patterns are there, pulsing and beating in the background, moving around and through us. Can't you feel it? I suppose not. People always seem so surprised when the thing that is supposed to happen does happen. I never saw the point in waiting, if something is to occur, why not have it occur earlier? If our lives are just a collection of thoughts, feelings and experiences, why wait? I gather that's strange though. That others feel differently about it. I cannot imagine why, it seems perfectly natural to move the pattern forward, to experience it now rather than later. As I've grown, I've put more effort into understanding it. Feeling the pattern comes naturally, pulling it forward takes effort. It's a bit like a muscle, your flex is a product of the work you've put into it. At first it was only by a second or two. Enough to be the first one who clapped but not enough that those around me thought anything about it. I'm further along now. Ten seconds for things within a system. A goal played within a sport. A twist in a soap opera. Simple things like that. Randomness is hard. The pattern is more chaotic when it comes to chance, harder to read, to understand. I think the pattern makers like chance best, as if it is their opportunity to drop the shackles of the ticking beat and color outside the lines. Perhaps that is why it interests me so. The challenge of reading the improvisation of the universe fascinates. Only five seconds for chance. I wonder what the limit is. Is there one? Could I pull the pattern forward enough to see tomorrow? It feels possible, just difficult. The beat becomes harder to anticipate, the chaos of chance interrupting and forking it this way and that. Maybe it is best to not know. As I've grown to understand the pattern I've found my actions disrupt it. The beat continues, but it is pushed off the mark by my reaction. I cheer before everyone else when the goal scores, and the others stare rather than cheer. A beat it missed. The pattern shifts. They do not like shifts. I cannot explain it beyond saying that my own pattern has changed. It is darker now. The beat is...faster. Irregular. Like an ailing heart pumping adrenaline. I try to be respectful, but it is hard to unsee something. I perceive the pattern and I react. I have built the muscles and I cannot allow them to fall into languor. I try not to clap for the goal before it has happened, but my pulse still quickens. I cannot be unknowing, no matter how much the pattern makers may desire it. I cannot help it and they cannot prevent it. Well. There are ways to stop it. They will come for me. It is still far off, but the event is certain enough that there can be no questions. There is no chance to it. No forks that lead me away from it. The patterns are theirs and they do not like one such as me meddling in it. I suspect they will come sideways. Straight on is something I will see. I must expect the unexpected. I must expand to see chance. To predict their improvisation. They know I prepare. Five seconds will not be enough. **Platypus OUT.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

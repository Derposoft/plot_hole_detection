"Gooooood Morning!!!" "Oh, fuck off Jennifer." After a year of this, I'm at the end of my nerves. Jennifer scoffs and scurries out of the room. I broke up with her six months ago, not that anyone remembers. My day just keeps starting over. Like a song stuck on repeat until it makes you so sick of it you prefer silence. It's my birthday. Again. Maybe I would care if it wasn't my 300-something birthday this year. Today was supposed to be New Year's, not that anyone knows that either. The sunrise is sickenly beautiful, the same streaks of pink and orange swirling in the sky. I wander out of the house and leave Jennifer to pout alone until she knows I'm gone. Today, I'm not going to go to work. Today I catch a train to New York City, to celebrate New Year's in the place of my dreams. I catch the 5pm train to get me there by 11. New York is lovely in September. It almost makes me glad I get to celebrate the holiday without freezing in a crowd of strangers. The tourists surround me as I stand under where the ball should be. I feel my eyes begin to tear up. "Happy New Years.." I murmur to myself. It's going to storm. It should be snowing. I feel a tap on my shoulder. "Excuse me... What did you just say?" She's about my age. Eyes are big, full of fear... or hope. Hard to tell. "I... Nothing." It's not worth explaining. I turn around to go, but she grabs my arm. "*No,* tell me what you said." Her eyes pierce me. I sigh. "I just said... Happy New Years." Her voice is quiet and rough, "Why?" "It's... I'm... Oh to hell with it you won't remember me tomorrow anyways. I-" She suddenly hugs me tightly. I feel her chest throb a couple of times as she looks up at me with a teary smile. "Me too." "You- you too?" I start to laugh. We just stare at each other for a while. "How long?" I finally ask. She holds up 4 fingers. "Four months?" She shakes her head sadly. "Four *years?*" I wrap my arms around her again, "My god, I'm so sorry. It's only been about one for me." "It's... okay. I'm glad I found you." she whispers. "Does it start over for you too when you go to sleep?" I nod. There aren't any benches nearby so we lay on the sidewalk. "It's my birthday, you know." "Today, or *today?*" she asks with a smirk. "Today." "Oh. Well then it's my birthday too." It begins to rain, but neither of us move. I take her hand in mine. Midnight comes too soon. "Happy New Years." "Happy New Years." "... Don't fall asleep, okay?" "I won't." "What's your name?" "Lewis." "Annabelle." "...That's a really beautiful name." "Thank you." "It fits you well." "How will I find you again?" "Meet me here, as soon as you wake up." "I will." "But don't fall asleep." "I won't." I feel her hand begin to fade from mine, and soon the rain begins to stop. I wake up to the same day. But this time, something is different. This time, I'll see her. And we will remember yesterday. Edit: Part 2 in comments (:

Try To Scare Me With Your Snake? Bring On The Christmas Pettiness by t2_4larhi7g

This happened when I was 15. Me *(female)* and my sister were living with our dad near the south coast in Australia at the time.

That Christmas we spent with my dad's sister and her kids *(Jay 17 and Ray 13)* for the week before Christmas until New Years. Me and my sister grew up around Jay and Ray and got along great with them so we were excited to spend Christmas with them. That, and our aunt lived on the beach so that made it even better.

When we arrived we did the customary "hello, great to see you. How are you? I haven't seen you in forever" yada yada introductions. It was a 3 hour car ride to get there and the south coast at Christmas time is hot as balls outside so we were grateful to be out of the car and inside with the air con.

Ray left to go to his room and I thought nothing of it, until he came back, walked up behind me, tapped me on the shoulder and said, with an evil smile on his face "Look what I got for Christmas."

Wrapped around his hand and shoulder was an impressively sized python. Ray stepped forward, holding his snake out to me and asked "You wanna hold it?" and by the look on his face I could tell that he was intending for me to be scared of the snake. But here's the thing; I grew up in the country and have avoided my share of brown snakes and red belly blacks, so needless to say, a baby python was nothing.

ME: *(with a* ***huge*** *smile on my face)* "OMG that's awesome! Yes!"

Ray had the most disappointed look on his face as he handed his snake over for me to hold. That wasn't the first time he'd tried to scare me or pull a prank on me, and up until that point, I'd never retaliated. Tis the season to be petty.

The next day we went into town and I bought what I needed to enact my revenge *(no animals or reptiles were harmed in the making of this post).*

Ray loved his reptiles *(he owned bearded dragons and had owned other reptiles when he was younger)* but he was deathly afraid of one reptile in particular. Frogs. I bought a motion activated garden ornament that made a ***ribbit*** noise every time you went past it.

The next morning before anyone else was out of bed, I snuck into Ray's room to plant the frog. He's a heavy sleeper an I knew he'd be out until at least lunch time, so I had no concern about being caught. I wedged it in his cupboard in a place I knew would be hard to find. Well enough hidden that it couldn't be seen but open enough that the motion detector would still work. His cupboard was right next to his door, so the frog would go off every time he went to leave his bedroom.

I set it in place, switched it on and went back to bed.

At around 11am I heard a loud squeal from Ray's room, followed by the sound of something being thrown against a wall. With the best concerned voice I could muster, I knocked on his door.

ME: "Ray, it's me. Are you ok? can I come in?"

RAY: "There's a damn FROG in my room!"

I went in to investigate and offered to help to look for it. My aunt came in to ask what the matter was and chuckled to herself when we told her and she walked out of the room. She's not a bad mum, far from it. She'd come to offer her help eventually, after she had her morning coffee.

I offered to help look for it, which inevitably meant I looked while Ray sat on his bed watching. Perfect. I subtly switched the motion sensor off while I "looked" for the frog. But of course, I couldn't find it. I left the room and waited for Ray to get into the shower before I snuck back into his room to switch it back on.

Ray spent the rest of the day in the lounge room, refusing to go back into his room out of fear of the frog he heard again after he got back to his room.

I waited until after dinner when I went back into his room, grabbed the frog and went back out into the lounge room. With an evil smile on my face and, with frog in hand, said "Look what I got for Christmas. You wanna hold it?"

The look of shock on his face was priceless as he realized what I'd done. Merry Frogmas.

######[](#dropcap) In Cleveland, a man and his pig board a plane. The pig is enthusiastic. The man has bought him a window seat. He is a large pig and he looks out the window eagerly as the plane takes off. Unbeknownst to the man and his pig, the world beneath them is unmade. As they fly from Cleveland to New York, the cumulative impossibilities of human imagination simultaneously come to pass. In a small town in Idaho a young boy wins a bet he should never have won. "I bet you I can lift the barn with the force!" "Yeah, when pigs fly Dwight!" A handshake and a snicker and Dwight reaches a hand out to the family barn. It shakes and quivers at the foundations and, to the detriment of its animal occupants, rises into the air. Dwight smiles ear to ear. The pig is buckled into his seat absurdly. His owner lets him lap at a cocktail and chuckles as he tapes the scene on his phone. In Kentucky the quiet town of Helen is spontaneously vaporized by an object from the heavens and reduced to ash, along with all of its occupants. Two months earlier a local madman had taken to the streets bedecked in placcards and signage. An asteroid, he said, was coming from the stars, sent by forces beyond anyones comprehension. Beware, he warned, for it would soon strike the small town of Helen and reduce it to rubble. The locals were unimpressed. Jack Lambard, born and raised in Helen, scoffed when he passed the lunatic. "Yeah, when pigs fly." The pig fell asleep - a little too much alcohol. It's owner snuck an eye mask over its pig eyes and snapped a photo for social media later. All the while his pulse raced thinking about the the real purpose of the trip. Three friends in Seattle sit around a table sipping their coffee, reading the news on their phone. One sees a headline of note. "You guys see this, Trump is polling almost on par with Clinton in Wisconsin according to Rasmusen." His two friends scoff. "Dude, I don't even know why anyone is paying attention to this election. It's done, she won already." The first friend gives a worried look. "I don't know man, it's worrisome that's all. He could win. It could happen." The two friends look back at their phones. One mutters, "yeah, when pigs fly." Over the intercom the plane's pilot announced their descent into Newark. The sound woke the pig up and it glanced around the cabin in confusion. The pig's owner patted it reassuringly on the neck. As the plane came in for a landing, the owner took out his phone and waited eagerly for his internet service to return. As all the phones in the plane began to beep and ring with countless insane news updates from around the world, the pig's owner opened his bank's app and checked the balance of his savings account. > $1,000,000,008 In the growing chaos of the airplane cabin, the pig's owner let out a celebratory hollar. All the other passengers stopped, went silent and looked up at him accusingly as the cacaphony of alarmed phones continued to ring and beep. The owner looked back at them all with abject disregard, his pig beside him. He shrugged.

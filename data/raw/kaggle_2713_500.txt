Further study is needed, but I believe these Humans will be an excellent addition to the labour force." &#x200B; ///First Contact Research Log - Entry 2498: Humanity/// "I have identified a subtype of Human that appears to be, not only more subservient, but generally more physically fit than the average population. They congregate in large village-like complexes, travel in orderly groups, and all wear identical or otherwise extremely similar clothing, which I believe is designed to help them conceal themselves in their natural surroundings, probably to avoid predators... further research is needed." &#x200B; ///First Contact Research Log - Entry 2555 - Supplemental: Humanity/// "Our results have been so satisfactory that Acquisitions has already begun collecting the uniformed specimens to use on the ship. We are all looking forward to their service. If my tests are any indication the Humans should make fine servants indeed." &#x200B; ///Ship's Log - Revolution 9298.55.02/// "Livestock Bay Door compromised. Type 3 Small Arms fire detected.

We are adrift somewhere in the Sol System near the Planet 03... we have been boarded by a hostile lifeform! The command crew are all dead or captured. I think... I think they're torturing the survivors. Do not believe the acquisition research! It's inaccurate! It's all wrong! The Humans are dangerous. They had some kind of weapons when we acquired them. I think... I think they work on some sort of internal chemical combustion system... with a mechanical trigger mechanism. We didn't scan for Type 3 arms, the Humans we studied were non-hostile and compliant! Now the Humans have our weapons too, and they've taken the ship.

And at that exact moment, Stanthony realized he was an 13,000 pound African war elephant. Again. "Shit" A few seconds ago he had been tending to a very nice field of onions with his trusty plow and mule, Vanessa and Ricardo. Then he'd suddenly he'd become a war pachyderm. He stood in formation with a group of other equally confused elephants, covered in steel plate armor. He looked off into the distance, where eh could see his beloved onion field had been completely covered up by a series of ugly squat wooden buildings. "Oh look, more *barracks*, how nice" the elephant to Stan's left said. "Yeah... great" The Leader had run out of space again and was converting the city into a giant war factory. The Leader must of hit the population limit too, hence Stan's sudden reincarnation as the largest land dweller of the great plains. Stanthony sighed. This wasn't the first time he had been plucked from civilian life and reconstituted as a Level 3 War Elephant. He knew were this was going. "Looks like *war* again, ay?" said the elephant so Stan's left. "...Yep" This would be the 12th time the great nation of Persia had mobilized and waged terrible, all consuming winner-takes-all stakes war with all the nations of the world. Today. And every time, it ended up the same way. Battle, carnage, destruction, retreat, slaughter. &#x200B; Then the Leader would load the save game and Stanthony would find himself back in the middle of the forest wearing a loincoth, foraging for berries. &#x200B; The elephant to Stan's left mused, "You know, that first bit actually isn't so bad, after we get slaughtered and all that, you know the bit after we start over and The Leader has to build up resources so he can build his *blasted* army again. Some people complain about the manual labour and all that, you know the berry gathering and the woodchopping and market and road building and what not. I don't mind it though. Had me a grain mill this time around. It was nice." &#x200B; Stanthony thought of his onion field. It had been nice. &#x200B; A horn sounded in the distance, and the sprawling army began it's slow march into enemy lands. &#x200B; Stanthony took one last look at home. The next time he saw it, he'd be wearing a loincloth foraging for berries. &#x200B; Again. &#x200B; "Well, time for murder and mayhem and all that, you know?" &#x200B; Stan sighed. &#x200B; "Yep. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B;

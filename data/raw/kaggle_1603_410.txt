A knock at the front door got my attention, but I chose to ignore it. Probably just another salesman from AT&T...or Xfinity...or one of my stalkers who was pissed I gave up Myspace. "But it was *my space*," they always complained in a hiss. "And you took it from me!" I sighed heavily, enjoying my bowl of corn flakes. Someone once said they were great, and I had to admit - I agreed wholeheartedly. Unexpectedly, the door smashed open and twenty soldiers rushed into my studio apartment. I froze in place. "You Tom from Myspace?" One of soldiers asked urgently. "Y-Yeah," I stuttered. "What's this all about?" "We need you to come with us!" He replied firmly. "The Facebookening..." He paused, his expression turning to horror. "It's happening!" My spoon fell out of my hand, hitting the edge of the bowl, sending it flying off the table and clattering onto the ground with a foreboding finality. Time seemed to slow for half a second as it settled on the floor, gently rocking back and forth. "I...umm..." I didn't know what to say.

"Let's go! You can finish your cereal on the way!" Well, okay then. Shit. He didn't have to tell me twice. I retrieved my spoon off the floor and stood up urgently. Then, my hands slowly lowered, further, further, until I was grabbing my bowl filled with milk and corn flakes - I didn't eat it dry like the idiots did in the commercial. "Alright," I announced. "I've got everything I need. Let's do this!" "You don't need anything else?" The soldier asked in confusion. "No computer? No flashdrives?" "Ha!" I exclaimed, tapping my temple. "It's all right here men. *I'm* the weapon!" Not to mention I hadn't been able to afford a computer in like five years, but they didn't need to know that. They all stared at me in awe, knowing I was their only hope. Finally, my time had arrived. # The fun continues in [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AuthorKurt/comments/9en3b4/facebook_apocalypse_part_2/)! &#x200B; [r/AuthorKurt](https://www.reddit.com/r/AuthorKurt) **Thanks for reading!

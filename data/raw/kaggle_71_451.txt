Grax shouted into the camera for the hundredth time, spittle spraying in an arc in front of him. I wondered, not the first time, if any was getting on the lens. If the camera feed went down or was at least blurred enough, I could possibly make some sort of escape without blowing my cover. "This man will die if you are not here in the next five minutes, Jade Enchantress! I know who he is, what he means to you!" A smile curled his lips as he spat this last threat, pointing a finger at me. The idiot villain really thought he had figured something out by tracking this version of me to most of the same places my superhero identity frequented. I sighed through my gag, my eyes rolling just a bit. Grax caught this, and slapped me across my face, his steel gauntlets causing my ears to ring slightly. If I were the slightly overweight middle aged man I appeared to be, that would have really done some damage. He's not very experienced with the "fragile human hostage" thing. "Be glad I have let you live this long. Your lover will be here soon, and then I shall end you both!" I cringed a little at "lover." The gender difference was weird as hell, and I really didn't like to talk about it. It's not like you can help what the ancient jade artifact grants you the power to turn into. I'd do it all over again to get the power of flight, super strength, and nigh-invulnerability. Who cares if when I do it I have to wear a bra and panties underneath my costume? Well, I do. A little. It's this secret that keeps me from shape-shifting right now and pummeling Grax's stupid, grotesque face. If I changed right now, my whole underwear line, books, and sponsorships would be in serious question. Not to mention my marriage. I looked into the camera, wondering how long it would take for any of my friends to do anything about this. Green Mantis was probably laughing his ass off right now, wondering how I got caught. Fucking cocktail parties. Opal Tiger was definitely shaking his head in disapproval, but most likely strapping his boots on. Trying not to sigh again, I leaned back a little in my steel folding chair, and waited.

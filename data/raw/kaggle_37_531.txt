It had been four months since I was taken. Throughout it all, Jack Black had just been... there. I don't know why. I don't know how. But he's just been roaming around the hallways, eating and giving me shit in equal order. I used to like him - his older stuff, at least - but now I was just about ready to kill him. He doesn't seem to be an alien - they look like nothing I'd ever imagined, let alone seen. But he doesn't seem to be their captive either. They seem to revere him, actually. I saw him walk past, the prison bars the only thing separating us. He was passionately air guitaring, and I sighed. I just couldn't help myself anymore. "What the hell are you doing here, Jack? What does any of this mean?" He put his finger up to shush me, continuing his guitar solo with one hand. When his imaginary crescendo ended, he sat down opposite me. "Aliens have been searching the galaxy for something," he said, resting his imaginary guitar against the wall, "and I'm totally the key to finding it." This was a personal revelation. I did not know why the aliens abducted me - could I be a key to their search as well? Jack Black and I, an unlikely duo? "What is it? Do you know something they don't?" I asked, feeling hope for the first time in months. Jack Black smirked, putting his hands in his pockets. "Course I do, dude-eo." "What is it??" "They're looking for *the greatest song in the world.*" I sat there in disbelief. This couldn't be real. Aliens with faster-than-light technology couldn't be so... *stupid*. "I wrote the tribute to it, of course," he continued, nodding with self-satisfaction, "can't remember it now though. Blew our fucking minds, man." "But that was just a dumb song!" I shouted, and he looked at me in surprise. "Your joke band wrote it- Tenacious D!" "You think it was a lie?" he asked, visibly hurt. "Not cool, bro. Not cool." I put my head in my hand, closing my eyes. I didn't know what to believe anymore. "I don't... ok, sure. Let's say it's real. Then where are we going?" He looked at me like I was an idiot. "To Satan, obviousli-rohnee," he said, standing up. "Me and Kyle played it to him, gotta go ask him if he remembers it." He stared out the window, as stars whizzed by. "Tough guy to reach these days," he added as an afterthought. I gazed up at him. Satan, aliens, all the experiments I've endured... was there some kind of cosmic purpose to all this? Was I somehow linked to *The Greatest Song In The World?* "And what about me, Jack?" I asked as he walked away, desperate for the answer. "Why did they bring me with?" He stopped, as if considering it for the first time. He looked back at me, shrugging. "Butt stuff, probably." ***** ***** If you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my new subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/) I'll try add new (and old) stories every day <3 Edit: Check out this [amazing reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/5h0bst/wp_jack_black/daxgeai/) of the story by /u/NachosGalore!

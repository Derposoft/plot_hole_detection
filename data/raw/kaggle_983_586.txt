I had barely pressed the crisp bills into Koko's hands when the shout came over the hedges. "Oi! I saw that! I bloody saw that!" The voice was unmistakable, and it did to my spirits what stepping into a mound of fresh elephant dung would have done. Koko tensed up immediately, and the bills disappeared behind her quicker than I could have said *Jumanji*. My fingers flashed as I signed to her to stay out of this. *Let me handle it*, I signed. *Shall I beat him up?* she signed back. *I can do it quick, before any of the others-* *No beating up the tourists!* I signed. Mr Humly stalked up to me, his wife and children tottering behind him. He thrust an accusatory finger into my chest. This close to him, I could smell the sour tobacco that wafted wherever he went, like a personal cloud. "I knew you were cheating us, you scumbag," he said. His teeth were clenched, his brows in a twist. Classic signs of aggression. "Hold on, hold on. There's not been any cheating here. I don't know what you're talking about." "No cheating? We signed up for an authentic safari experience! Not this... This crummy, shitarse tour you've been giving us! Why are all the lions so tame! Why are all the apes so docile! Where are the goddamned warring rhinos you promised us?" *The hell he's talking about?* Koko signed. *The rhinos never fight. Jamoo and Jabeel are best friends, FFS.* *Shh, he's just angry now.* *Give him a banana then.* "And there's the proof!" Mr Humly continued. "You're all in cahoots! This is all staged! The animals are all just... Two-bit circus attractions! Paid off charlatans!" "Harold, please," his wife said, hand pulling back on his sleeve. "Let's just go, you're scaring the children." "No, I won't go, Susie! We signed up for an *authentic* safari tour, and we're not leaving till we get what we paid for!" *You want me to beat him now? Chop chop?* I ignored Koko, then turned to face Mr Humly directly. "Sir, if you must know, this was all done for your own safety. Our customers don't *really* want the full experience of what it's like to live in the wild with these animals." "Don't tell me what I want or don't want! I've trained in combat survival, I'll have you know! I bet I can survive out here better than a lying tour guide like yourself!" I sighed. "Fine, I'll upgrade your tour package for you then. To our highest tier, free of charge. You'll just have to sign *these* indemnity forms here, OK?" Koko snorted as Mr Humly tended to the paperwork. I knew she was already preparing for the anticipated windfall. *Same incentives apply?* she signed. *I guess...* *Extra ten dollars for every scream we get out of them?* I nodded, and Koko leapt away, no doubt to let her brethren know first. I couldn't blame her - the rest of the safari were pretty damn competitive, especially the giraffes. It was always the tamest looking ones. "So, what's this highest tier of the package called?" asked Mr Humly, as he posed for a selfie with his family. The smugness had settled over his face as surely as the real African sunset. "Gotta let all our friends on Instagram know that we had the true experience here!" I smiled as I led him back to our jeep. "The *Lord of the Flies* package, my dear sir." --- /r/rarelyfunny

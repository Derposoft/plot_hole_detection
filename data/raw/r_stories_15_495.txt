Karen Assumes I Can't Talk- I Put Her In Her Place by t2_4larhi7g

Not sure if this story belongs here but I hope you enjoy it anyway. This is a true story.

Backstory: I suffered a spinal cord injury in 2007 (when I was 17). I'm a C4-5 **incomplete** quadriplegic with an acquired brain injury (fell off a roof drunk if you're curious). While in ICU and rehab after my injury I had to learn how to talk and communicate all over again (now, 12 years later, you can't tell I'm brain damaged when I speak). Public settings are fine for me as I have zero trouble with day to day life (apart from being confined to a wheelchair). It's not that common that my verbal skills are an issue. Only when others **make it an issue**. This story is one such occasion.

I was out for lunch with my family one day at a coffee *(in a busy and high traffic area in my town)*. We were waiting at a table for someone to take our order.

A staff member came to take our order a few minutes later.

Karen: *(barely acknowledging I was there and only speaking to my aunt and uncle)* "Hi. what can I get you guys?"

My aunt and uncle told Karen what they want and I was about to say what I wanted when Karen said: "And what would **SHE** like?" *(meaning me)*

My aunt and uncle were shocked, having never encountered this reaction before. Me, however, this wasn't my first rodeo. I decided to play along. I gave my aunt and uncle a sideways smirk *(begging them to play along and not say anything)* and slid the menu to them, pointing awkwardly at what I wanted and giving a strange grunting noise. My uncle understood this and decided to play along.

Uncle: "Ok, OP will get the chicken sandwich and a strawberry milkshake. And can she have a straw with that? She has trouble with her hands." *(I don't)*.

Our meals arrived and we ate our lunch and chatted normally *(out of ear shot of Karen).*

When we were done, Karen came up and asked us how our meals were (ignoring me). My aunt and uncle let me handle it.

ME: "It was fantastic. The chicken was very well cooked and the milk shake was really good. Although your customer service skills need some practice. Although I'm brain damaged I would have appreciated you spoke to me, and not assume I'm incapable of vocalizing my order."

I had never seen someone's face go so red and embarrassed. Karen apologized awkwardly and took my uncle's credit card to pay.

The morel of the story: Never assume someone's abilities or inabilities. We are all human and deserve respect, no matter what we look like or sound like. I don't sound brain damaged which is something I've been told many times. Sometimes as a compliment and other time not kindly. But it shouldn't matter if I did. Disabled or not, we all deserve respect.

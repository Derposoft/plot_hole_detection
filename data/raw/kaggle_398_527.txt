I wonder what's trending on YouTube right now. Wait, Jason's picking me up, must want to talk to someone. Jason: Hey daisy Ooo, daisy. Should've known. They've been talking for a year now. Hopefully this is the night. Daisy: Hey Jason! Jason: What's up? Daisy: oh nothing much, just got off work. How about you?  Emojis! She's definitely happy to see him. Don't fuck this up mate. Jason: Ah, it's going good. Finally got word from my publisher, book is out. Daisy: Awesome! I'm so proud of you. Jason: Well I couldn't have done it without my favorite editor  There you go tiger! Daisy: Well it's the least I can do for such a good friend  Jason: You've done so much for me already, I can't think of a way to pay you back. *Eat her out.* Daisy: oh you don't have to pay me back, your friendship is worth so much to me already. Jason: That's good to hear. Stop being awkward man and just tell her you love her already. Jason: so... how are you? NO! Don't fucking go awkward on me now man! I've watched you beat around the bush for too long! This girl likes you and you know it, and If i have to help you lock it down, then damnit, I WILL!" ***Autocorrect!*** Jason: How about I take you out to dinner to celebrate? Jason: "Wait, what? I didn't write that." Jason: sorry, didn't mean to write that, autocorrect must be weirding out. ***Delete*** Jason: "Seriously, what the hell?!" I'll just type "Don't worry man, just go with it" into the box and delete it. Hopefully he's not too confused. Daisy: Oh, that sounds nice, but like I said you don't have to pay me back. Jason: ok, that's fine. Just thought it'd be nice. ***Autocorrect!*** Jason: No don't worry about it, it's my gift to me and you. Besides, it's been almost a year since we've met. We have a lot to celebrate Jason: "Oh god, this phone is gonna ruin me." Daisy: Tru. Alright, it's a date. What day? Jason: "ok... maybe it isn't all bad." Jason: You free Saturday? No you idiot, she told you, she's got to see her mom on Saturday! ***Autocorrect!*** Jason: Is tonight at 7 good? Jason: "WHAT?!" Daisy: That's perfect actually. I'll get ready now. There's seems to be a mixture of confusion and happiness in Jason's face. I think I did my work here well. Jason: Alright I'll get ready too. See you tonight. ***Autocorrect!*** Jason: Alright I'll get ready too. See you tonight beautiful  Jason: "NO DONT PUT THAT!" Daisy: Hahaha! You're too cute. See you tonight handsome  Well that's the end of that conversation. I think I did my job well. Wait, whys Jason going to the autocorrect settings? He's turning it off? Well I'll just turn it back on. Jason: "what the hell?!" Oh, wait, should probably explain. I'll just open up the note pad, "you gave me 4G, I give you GF." I think he understands now. He's putting me on the charger and going to get ready. He better not mess this up. Now, back to YouTube...

There is nothing around me. No sound. No light. No voices. No touch. I can move, I think, but I don't know if I just move my limbs or move around in ... space? Not space. Something. I'm dead, obviously. The sound and the light could be part of an experiment, but the void, for lack of better words, is beyond anything people could do to me. Logical conclusion: Dead. I won't be the clueless idiot who can't see past her own nose and acknowledge simple facts. I read too much Fantasy and Sci-Fi for that, and willful ignorance has always annoyed me. The last thing I remember is being bored on the train, on my way to visit my mother. I wonder if it was something natural-ish, or if somebody blew up the train. I mean, it could have been one of those disasters where two trains run into each another, but those are terribly rare. Interesting investigations, though ... **Focus**, Lina. This is not the time. I heard that you can go insane *really fast* if you are in a completely isolated room, so that's going to be fun, because I have never encountered anything more isolated than this. I wonder for how long I can entertain myself. I can review some knowledge, and the movies I saw, the books I read, I suppose. I could review my life, if I wanted to go insane faster rather than slower. I doubt I'll think up any new and original deep thoughts before I go insane. Maybe after? This is ridiculous. "This is ridiculous!" - I say, and hear nothing. But I know I have spoken. How does that work? I should hear at least something. Sound originates in my body, so some sound waves propagate through the body, reach my ears that way. I touch my throa... nope, I *try* to touch my throat. Nothing there. Can't touch. No body. No fucking body. No hands to touch anything with. What is it that I think I am moving? Do I have literally ghost limbs? I start to giggle hysterically, because the alternatives are even worse. "What the fuck is going on?" - again with the not-speaking. Hysteria seems like a good state right now. "Can anybody hear me? If this is some cosmic experiment, of if you just forgot to pick me up, **NOW WOULD BE A FUCKING GOOD TIME**!" ... Skipping the denial - I never liked that anyways - and dropping straight into bargaining. "Just give me a sign, at least? Something, anything! Let me hear ... something? Let there be light?" And there was light. ... Oh, bugger.

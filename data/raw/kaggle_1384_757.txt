Sorry for my bad English it is not my first language. I was arrested because of my country's corrupt legal system but I have the equivalent 100 us million dollars in our currency in my bank account that had been frozen. However due to a legal loophole the money can be transferred to a foreign account and then back to my account unfrozen. So if you can please open a foreign bank account at any bank in Nigeria and deposit 10000 dollars and send the bank details and pin to me. I'll get my contact to transfer the money and then you give me your bank details and I'll transfer a million dollars to you as a reward. Please help my family needs money. Yours sincerely, A Nigerian Prince (Due to another legal loophole I cannot disclose my name) *** To: 10000 Recipients Subject: Nigerian prince in need of help - more money Hello all, You might have seen my email last week.

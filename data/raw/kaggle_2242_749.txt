*Where am I?* The question is automatic, but so is the answer. *Dead. Squished. A meat crayon on a back road somewhere. Didn't even see the guy cross the median, or feel the impact. Once alive, now dead.* *On and off. As easy as flicking a light switch.* *But I'm somewhere, at least. Not nowhere.* *So that's interesting.* There's a room and a girl. Both small, cramped and cold. Her hair is dirty, unwashed and frizzy. Her arms thin and face slightly sunken. *Where am I?* At a table. There's a mish-mash of plastic utensils and plates, all from seemingly random and disparate design. A pink teacup in front of me. "More tea, Mr. Snuffles?" The girls voice is more a squeak than anything else. Absurdly, I pick up the cup and hold it outward as she takes a small white kettle and pours some pretend tea. *I'm supposed to be dead. I'm here, in a little girls room, having some kind of strange tea party, though I'm here and not here. Part of me is a corpse.* *Part of me is something...else.* "Uh, thank you." I say. At least my voice is normal. She drops the kettle, and it clatters onto the table. "You've never talked back before," she says. Not afraid, no, she doesn't seem like the kind of girl prone to skittish fear. She's hunched over, like she's ready to run and hide at any moment. *Someone has hurt her. How?* *How do I know?* "Well, now I do, I think." It's a stupid thing to say, but I'm not entirely here right now. *Part corpse. Part air. Sitting in a little girl's chair.* She smiles. Her teeth are crooked. We sit in silence, mimicking sipping tea. The room is surprisingly bare beyond old toys and dirty clothes. There are holes in some of the walls. Fist sized holes. There's a shout. "Ashley!" The name is slurred, not spoken but spat. *He's going to hit her,* the thought comes unbidden. But true. "Is that your daddy?" I ask. "Yes." "Where's your mommy?" "Daddy says I killed her." The girl says it flat and intoned. Something ingrained as an inevitable truth, something flattened and hammered. "He comes up to remind me," she says again. Emotionless. *The man tells her this thing. The father tells the daughter. His wife and her mother died giving birth, and he has never forgiven her. He loves her. He hates her. He doesn't know what else to do.* A man comes into the room, and I stand. He doesn't see me. *He doesn't know you. Part of you is dead, part of you is here.* "There you are," he spits. Dead or not, I can smell booze. One step. Two steps. *Push him.* *Why? I'm dead. Not here. Not really.* *Push him. Push him now, push him hard.* I push. The man is launched backwards, slamming into the wall and slumping forward, causing the girl to give a shout of surprise. In another moment I'm beside him, sitting next to him. *Don't do that again,* I whisper. *Don't ever try that again.* His head jerks up, looking around, searching for a disembodied voice that he'll never find, never truly know. He begins to cry. An ugly, hoarse and hopeless thing. *He doesn't know why he does it. He doesn't question or bother. There's power in violence, and he uses it the only way he knows, from the only thing that can't hit him back.* The girl is frozen in place, afraid of what is to come. She doesn't need to be afraid. She has me. I walk over and offer a hand, and hesitantly she takes it. "When he gets up, him and I are going to have a talk, Ashley." She nods. We walk past him, the shaking man looking at bruised and calloused hands. "Things should be better around here," I tell her, and mean it. *Imaginary friends, for those who need them the most.* A voice from nowhere and everywhere. The girl smiles again, the crooked teeth and sunken eyes hopeful for the first time in a long time. *You can make the man change for the better. For the girl. For those who need their imaginary friends.* Imaginary friends, or guardian angels. To me, the dead man who is here but not here, I find those things to be one and the same. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ r/storiesfromapotato - for stuff from me r/redditserials - for stuff from me and others

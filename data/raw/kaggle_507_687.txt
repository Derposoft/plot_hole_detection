"Seriously?" I shouted. "That's not *physically possible!*" The monster giggled and shifted into another Escher-esque contortion. I stabbed at a tentacle-arm-branch thing with my magical sword, but it moved to a different dimension at the last second. I sighed with frustration. "Can't catch me!" it crooned in a sing-songy voice. Well, it would've been sing-songy had it not also stirred primal fears deep within the most ancient folds of my brain. Demons tend to do that, regardless of whether they were plotting your execution or commenting on a cup of tea. I bounced back, dodging one of its sudden lunges. No doubt it thought this was all in good fun, but those razor-sharp claws were no joke to me. I took a deep breath and quickly assessed the situation. The arena was a spectacular disaster; it was going to cost me a fortune in repairs. Assuming I make it out alive to argue with the parents over a stupendous therapy bill. Inner demons were always dangerous, but I hadn't expected such a challenge from a *kid*. I glanced over at the child in question. He continued to slumber peacefully in the Trance Room where I had left him. "Pay attention to meeeeee!" it roared. A wild burst of energy came out, and I barely focused enough to thwart it with an arcane shield. The aftershock sent me down to my knees, though. "You spoiled brat," I muttered, staggering back up. But then a thought occurred to me. "Hey, why do you this anyway? What do you get out of it?" "It's fuuuuun," it drawled. "I tease Matthew alll daaaaay, especially when he talks to Susie, the little girly he feels weird about. And he gets so shy and his words get stupid and I love it!" "Sure, sure, I get that," I said conversationally, sending another blast of lightning at it. My shot missed wildly, but I didn't mind. "But isn't it boring when he comes home, and you can't mess with him anymore?" It shrugged, or some demonic equivalent. Whatever it was, my ceiling shuddered in response. "Yeah, but I just wait until the next day. No sweat." "Here's a thought," I said, trying to muster up excitement. "Why don't you come live in me?" For the some time since the battle began, it seemed to be taken back. The reply came after a moment of silence. "Why would I want to do that, mister? You're a meanie." "But I deal with people and stress aaaaaall day," I replied. "You could totally ruin my life, and it would be more fun than dealing with some sniveling kid." "Why would you want me?" it replied, eyeing me suspiciously. With all forty of its eyes. "I think I could fight you," I goaded. "Matthews is just a child, of course you're having an easy time with him. But I would be much more of a challenge. Maybe too much of one...?" It went crazy, and I pulled up a strong shield, thinking that I had offended the blasted thing. But it shot nothing out, or came at me. "No! I want to inhabit you now!" It shouted, its voice thundering in my ears. "Oh boy, mister. You are in for some fun times now!" "No doubt. Now I'm going to quickly set up the spell, just go with it..." I focused with my staff, muttered a few ancient words, and the sorcery began. Normally, trapping a demon was difficult, especially one that was so unpredictable. But it had given me *permission*. The magic flowed like rainwater, and soon the arena was quiet once more. Completely ruined, but quiet nonetheless. At least I'll get a pretty penny out of this, I told myself. That cheered me up. Self-containment procedures were covered under "extreme" hazard pay. Sometimes I wanted to argue that fighting the demons in general should be extreme hazard pay, but whatever. As I walked to the Trance Room to awaken Matthews, I couldn't help but grin. I couldn't wait for this new inhabitant of mine to meet my resident inner demons. _______________________________________ *Liked that? More stories [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Idreamofdragons/)!*

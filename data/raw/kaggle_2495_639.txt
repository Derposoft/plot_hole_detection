*Fill in the blank:* ***Law of conservation of mass*** ***Law of conservation of matter*** ***Law of conservation of _______*** I bit the inside of my cheek again. I really should have studied for this one. I'm pretty sure it had something to do with a finite thing. Like... temperature? Maybe it was a more physical term. Maybe it was anatomy? I'm not even sure what that is, but I was pretty sure that the conservation thing ended with a -y. I wrote in anatomy. The room shook a bit like the Earth was shifting to adjust its weight, but I think I was just imagining it. "Five more minutes," Mr. Shefner said, knocking the nub of his arm on the desk. Five minutes? I began to sweat, but I was on the last short answer question. ***Define the law you filled in above*** Ah, crud. I scribbled as fast as I could. *The idea that anatomy doesn't leave this world, but instead is always transferred from one thing to the next. It is always conserved over..* Something felt off, but the more I wrote, the more I believed in my own stories. My hand started cramping. I wished I had more energy in it. As if a placebo kicked in, energy restored itself into my hand out of nowhere. I flexed it a couple of times to be sure and went back to finishing the statement. *..a system. No anatomy can be said to be lost, just placed somewhere else--* "AAHHH!" I jumped in my seat when the guy next to me screamed and slapped his arm. "Jimmy?" Mr. Shener asked, looking peeved. "Is there a bug or something, please don't distract the-- *Dear Lord!*" he slapped his good hand over his mouth to hold back his lunch as Jimmy held up his arm that had two hands on it. One young, one significantly older. "Jimmy, what is--" "I don't know! I don't know! It just showed up! Get it Ahh!" he slapped it a few more times with his lonely hand. In his hysteria, Jimmy flopped out of his desk and Mr. Shefner ran around the room to tend to him. "That.. it looks like my old hand!" Shefner said in shock. Whatever he said, I completely ignored to take a glance at Jimmy's test. *Energy!* That was the name of the law. I scribbled out my old answer and began writing the new one. As soon as I did, the cramping in my hand came back, but I wasn't about to risk not finishing in time. "Where did it go, Jimmy!?" the teacher screamed. "I don't know! It just--" I heard a head thud to the floor. He probably passed out right when I finished the test. "Swagster, can you take him to the nurse's office? I think he was playing some sort of prank and went too far," he said to me. I looked at him quizzically and realized he was referring to me with what I wrote as my name on my test. Must have taken a glance at it and thought it funny to call me that. "Sure thing," I said, getting up, "I'm sure he's fine, though." When I knelt down, he woke up, his face devoid of the conflict in it from moments before. "I'm fine, I'm fine," he said, getting up quickly. "Was that some sort of magic trick to try and lighten the mood of the test, Jimmy? Because it wasn't funny," Shefner said sternly. "No, it was..." he looked confused like he was trying to put it together. He was a good actor. I gave him a lighthearted smile. "You're crazy, man," I laughed, patting him on the back. His eye twitched as a look of insanity took over his face. _______________________________________________ For more stories, come check out /r/Nazer_The_Lazer!

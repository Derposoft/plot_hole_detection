There was a flash of indigo light, and suddenly I was no longer in my room. I looked around in alarm, wondering what the fuck had just happened, noticing that I was in the middle of a huge amount of people, and for some reason they were all backing away from me as fast as they could. I could hear hushed conversation from some of the people nearest to me, "Holy shit, that poor guy!" "Damn, that guy is fucked... I hope they go away when he dies though..." "Yeah, the people in that universe don't even know about their magic and psychic powers, because their home is so infested with demons that it's taking everything they have just to hold them off, they have nothing left over to do anything with..." At that, I became aware of shadowy black shapes rushing around and above me, in the shape of a giant humanoid figure. This, understandably, freaked me out quite a bit, but my experience with anxiety let me keep in control of myself for the moment. I continued taking in my surroundings, noticing a banner at the end of the tremendous room that looked almost like a gymnasium. The banner said, "Multi-versal Free-For-All, brought to you by Godly Media LLC, Sponsored by Dimensional Manipulations Incorporated." Upon seeing this, I sat upon the ground and began to think, still being stared at by the countless psychics, wizards, and other reality manipulators from other dimensions. Tentatively, within my mind, I thought, "Hello, Demons?" **"Greetings, worm." At this, I held my head in agony as the multitude of voices grated into my mind with the power of a jet engine. "We seem to have been chosen to represent our reality, so here's what's going to happen. We will enter your body, like we would if we were going to possess you, however, we will leave you in control, and leave you as soon as this farcical game is completed. While 'possessed' you will be immune to all magic or psychic abilities, the only thing you will have to worry about will be decapitation from blessed items. You will then use your wish to free us from our earthly imprisonment, and to repay you, we will give you three wishes afterwards, and will not attempt to turn them from what you intended when making the wish."** Naturally, this cacophonous exposition had me a bit worried seeing as demons were well known for lying, until I heard a soft whisper that filled me with peace. *"Do not worry, Chosen, Demons are bound by the letter of their spoken word, they are entirely truthful. I am the God of your home dimension, and there are more things going on here than you could possibly know. Have faith, and all will be well."* Now, as I had been agnostic before this, I was a bit skeptical for a moment before I remembered my current circumstances. Deciding that I might as well go with it, and intimidate my enemies while I'm at it, I put on my best demonic voice, and screamed at the top of my lungs. **"Alright! I'll do it!"** At this, the shadows began flowing into my body continuously, remind me of that scene from Stranger Things when Will got possessed. My screaming had attracted attention from the surrounding Chosen, and upon seeing the demons flowing into my body, a wide majority of them began screaming in horror, and all of them began running away from me. **"Let's do this!"** I growled forcefully, feeling the rushing power in my veins, I went to launch some sort of energy attack, and gouts of Hellfire flew from my outstretched fingers, weaving around and through themselves. Upon reaching the nearest Chosen, an eye-searingly bright wall of white light appeared between my Hellfire and them, dissipating it harmlessly. A booming voice came from above, somehow filling me with peace while simultaneously being the loudest thing I had ever heard. *"All Chosen will wait until the start of the match to begin hostilities, or be returned to their own reality."* I nodded to myself, sat down, and laid back with my hands under my head, and asked the Demons to immerse me in their memories of combat until the match began. My vision faded to black, and the visions began. I intended to win, no matter what it took.

The request did not make sense. It was too quick and unprofessional. Attempts by the communications crew to reestablish contact had failed. There were more than a thousand sensors and experiments recording data and relaying them to earth. "We're not able to get the signal through," Viktor said in his thick Russian accent. "To which lab?" I asked. "To any of them." I sped through the module to the cupola node at the end. Sunita was already there, peering through the observatory. "Where are we?" I peered at the large landmass underneath. "Over Central Asia, moving South East." Not a very populated region. But it was a lot darker than usual. "A cloudy night?" "Don't think so." Sunita snapped. Look over there, she pointed to a second pane towards the South West. "Over there should be New Delhi, which is a huge blob. But even if they had a powercut, then look forward, we're approaching the eastern coastline of Asia. We should see Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei... all of them are dark. I've never seen anything like this before." "No response from the Russians, the Europeans, the Americans or the Japanese." Viktor shouted from across. I moved back to the central module where everyone could hear me. "Everyone, shut down all communications. Turn off all lights except the emergency lights. Close down all systems. Only the tranquility node and one rehydration dispenser stays open. Put on your space suits and connect them directly to the Oxygen tank. We don't know how long we'll remain without ground support so we need to conserve as much as we can." I'd been in the Air Force before this, and my military instinct kicked in. I could sense danger. I put on my suit and went up the observatory. The others followed after shutting down their systems. "Approaching the western coast of South America." Sunita said. The sun had just Shone on Chile. Across the horizon the northern icecaps of the Antarctic glistened. In the South a blazing green of the Aurora Australis was visible. Something was wrong. "Everyone, move to the Solar observation deck." We made our way to the other end of the module. This one didn't have panels, only displays. "Switch it on," I told Satoshi. "But keep the communication link disabled." "What's wrong, Captain?" Satoshi asked as he nervously operated the system. "The Southern lights, there was something strange about them." Sunita nodded. "As if something with a massive magnetic field had distorted them." They switched on the solar cameras. "Solar flares are unusually subdued." Satoshi said. "Wait, I don't think someone has parked a satellite at the third Lagrange point." There were five Lagrange points between the Earth and the Sun. NASA had parked solar telescopes at two of them. The others were supposed to be empty. "It's not a satellite." I said. It was too massive, almost planetary. "Uh, guys." Viktor said, nervously. Everyone turned to look at him. Everything shook. My visor almost cracked as it smashed against the microgravity glovebox. The trembling was over. No one spoke. They all knew what it was, they'd seen it dozens of times. Except earlier, it would be with a warning and they'd all be fastened secure. It was the transfer of momentum from a module docking on to the space station. --------- More: [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5i108w/wp_you_are_an_astronaut_in_the_iss_the_last/db4xw16/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5i108w/wp_you_are_an_astronaut_in_the_iss_the_last/db52y37/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5i108w/wp_you_are_an_astronaut_in_the_iss_the_last/db5b92n/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5i108w/wp_you_are_an_astronaut_in_the_iss_the_last/db6aq64/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5i108w/wp_you_are_an_astronaut_in_the_iss_the_last/db6v402/), [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5i108w/wp_you_are_an_astronaut_in_the_iss_the_last/db9hzj8/), [8](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5i108w/wp_you_are_an_astronaut_in_the_iss_the_last/dba5x6c/), [9](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5i108w/wp_you_are_an_astronaut_in_the_iss_the_last/dba5xcs/) THE END.

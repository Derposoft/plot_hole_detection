Real Story. Abusive roommate thought my severe depression was bullshit and toke it upon himself to make my life even more unbearable. Too bad for him he was faking his employment for immigration purposes and I denounced him, that and also some extra ''in the moment'' petty revenge. by t2_dqwxf

I have bipolar disorder and mild autism. Before diagnosis and medication I would have these intense bouts of depression or mania but I would always attribute it to my current living situation.

My last job was a sales job and I only lasted 3 months before my weak ass social skills were exposed and ridiculed, frankly put I was way too introverted to be a salesman, it's even more embarrassing when I remember how confident I was going into the job (I was on the end of a manic phase).

So now after that experience I was at the bottom of the barrel and started slipping into a severe depression and after a while I was having regular suicidal thoughts. I started therapy, my roommate objected, he said therapy is a scam and mental illness is just something you can simply shake off and that I just need to use the money for my therapy to go on vacation. Clearly there was something off with his thinking but we didn't argue further at that point.

Every day I was miserable, could barely get out of bed and felt completely dead inside, after a couple week he ''got tired of it'' and started harassing me:

''If you're gonna kill yourself at least give me some money before you do''

''You're not sick you're just lazy and weak, I don't even believe you're suicidal''

''Don't lock the front door before leaving the house, no one is gonna break in, you're stupid for doing that'' \*\*on that one his tone was super judgmental, trying to order me around\*\*

\*\*leaves the knifes out on the counter, I tell him not to and that the knives are mine, the tells me to fuck off and that he'll do whatever he wants, I toke the knives back to my room coz they're mine after all and also they made me think of cutting myself, he then went and bought cheap ass dollar store knives and put them on the counter\*\*

''This is just a game you're playing, you want attention''

\*\*I accidentally dropped a bedsheet on the floor, comes in the room right after, immediately starts to literally yell at the top of his lungs at me over that bedsheet and how I purposely dropped it to spite him, I did no such thing, I was trying to explain but I couldn't do it over him yelling, he was at max volume over a fucking bedsheet\*\*

\*\*While riding in his car, I'm in the passenger seat with takeout food we bought, I had been friends with him for over 2 years and I never dropped anything ever in his car, I almost dropped one of the bags and he exploded at me, even worst, when I told him to chill out and that this never happened before he just got more mad at me for even talking back, he even said the words ''don't talk back to me this is my car'' \*\*

\*\*While smoking weed, passes the joint to the another person while I was next, I tell him it's my turn, he starts telling me I'm wrong and stupid\*\*

That was the last straw, I was completely blinded by rage, soon after the weed incident I did some minor damage to his car, broke the A\\C he had in his room and burned a bunch of his mail in my bathroom sink (including a letter that was telling him to pay a fine for parking ticket)

Now here's some important stuff to know about this guy:

\- He used to sell credit cards, but often would lie to the customer telling him or her that it was just a gift card they were getting.

\- He was a door-to-door salesman for about a year, he would sit in his car with his buddies all day and just do the minimum amount of sales to not get fired, while pocketing a good base salary, eventually he got fired anyway

\- He was pretending to be a manager at a company owned by his friend's uncle, he had them pay him a salary and he would repay them. With intention of getting approved for his permanent residence.

So in conclusion, about a week after moving out, I called immigration and gave them his name, address, the details of his fake employment, etc. That was 2 years ago, I have no idea what happened to him since.

Lost friendship by t2_dfi5gtaq

I've debated sharing this story for a long time since it happened years ago back around 2006-2007.   I was still a teenager when all this happened and living in Dunn NC. I was close friends with a guy named Dillion. We did everything together growing up we hung out after school at his house rode around in his go kart,we even hung out at the dirt hill next door to his house riding bikes up and down it and hanging out with the other neighborhood kids. 
I lived directly down the street from him so it was easy to get together and hang out.When we got to be teenagers things started to change however.He had a trampoline in his back yard we would always be jumping on,one day we were wrestling on it and one thing led to another we started rubbing on each other but never went further.One day we were next door at his dad's house and we were "wrestling" when his mom walked in and caught us.She was furious and said"you need to leave now and go home" and I did.
Our friendship was really awkward after that we hardly hung out anymore and we didn't speak at school or on the bus.One day though I was out riding my bike around the neighborhood and spotted Dillion with a couple of guys on the dirt hill hanging out.He saw me and called me over and when I got there I saw they were really tall guys slightly buff one wearing a leather tank top jacket I made small talk with them until Dillion asked me have you had any women lately? I said no to which he then asked me have you had any lately to which I said no and then he asked me if I had any guys lately to which I also said no.
He then asked me if I wanted some to which I said yes.Him and his friends led me into the woods behind the dirt hill and acted like they were about to undress when Dillion suddenly spat at me and him and the other guys ran off leaving me behind when I got back to the dirt hill they were walking back to his house laughing.I hopped on my bike and sped home upset and about to cry.I was so embarrassed.I didn't speak to dillion for a while after that.
One day I was sitting at the dirt hill alone in my thoughts when I saw him and another guy named josh I knew from high school walking towards me from his house.I didn't say anything much, they tried to make small talk with me and eventually Dillion brought up the same question as before whether I had any women lately and I said no as usual he asked me again if I had any guys lately to which I said no again.He asked me again if I wanted some and stupidly I said yes.
As soon as I said that him and josh walked away laughing ,it was only then that I realized that josh had his flip phone out the entire time recording our conversation.I was so upset and embarrassed I just went straight home.Thankfully me and my family moved from there not long after I never heard or saw him again,I tried reaching out to him on Facebook and myspace years later mainly because I wanted to make peace with what happened between us but I never heard back from him. 
Some part of me hates him for how he treated me and another part blames myself for letting things get that far and another part of me misses the good times we had growing up just being friends and hanging out before everything went south.Last I heard hes living a playboy lifestyle in Florida.I just wanna say I forgive him for what happened in the past and hope he finds happiness.This story was 100% true and if you wanna hear more personal stories but more optimistic please let me know

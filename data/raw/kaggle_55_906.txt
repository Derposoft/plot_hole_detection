I slammed the door so hard that the *crack* echoed down the hall. Tom, who had been slumped over on top of his desk, jolted upright instantly, shook his head, and blinked rapidly. "I'm up," he said groggily. There were little lines pressed into his cheek in the exact pattern of the desk's wood grain. "Sure, Tom." I placed a cup of coffee on his desk and headed over to my own. "What's the point of even coming in early if you're just going to fall asleep at your desk? Why not just stay in bed and come in at a normal hour?" He shrugged and cradled the cup of coffee like it was the most precious thing he'd ever seen in his life. "You know... gotta try to work on that backlog. Boss's orders." We both looked over at the far wall of the office, where a big portrait of God hung directly under the words "Department of Prayers and Wishes." He'd given us a *direct order* to work on our case backlog, but with just the two of us in the office, there really wasn't a lot we could do. Things had been manageable when it was just the two humans down on Earth in that Garden, but it had since spiraled a bit out of control. No amount of overtime was going to allow us to respond to *every* human request with 7 *billion* of them scurrying around down there. But God, being omnipotent and all, had a bit of a hard time understanding the idea that we just *can't* do it. So we just soldiered on as best we could. Just as I picked up the first folder of the day, Marie came trundling in with a cart just *full* of more folders. "Where should I put these, Hon?" she asked. The cart wheel squeaked as she brought it to the center of the room. There had to have been hundreds of thousands of new wishes in this load. *Ugh*. I sighed. My inbox was so full that the looming tower of folders was only able to stay in place because the top was firmly squished against the ceiling. "Ummmm...." I looked around the room and managed to find some more space in the far corner. "Here, I guess." I wouldn't be able to get to them for quite a while anyway, so it didn't really matter. "Is that everything from yesterday?" I asked Marie as she began to pile them on the floor. She laughed. "This is just from *midnight to 2 AM* yesterday," she said over the armload of folders. I just groaned in response. *That* was from the satellite shift? For some reason, God had thought it was a good idea to collect wishes and prayers even when everyone in Heaven was asleep. As if we weren't overworked enough. And that was generally not a very busy time of day; I shuddered to think how many more we'd have by noon. "And," Marie continued, "I've got about 12 more of these carts for you." "Fine," I rolled my eyes. We'd have to annex another overflow room from the Department of Smiting and Wrath. Ever since God's son went down to mingle with the humans, he'd gotten a big soft spot for them and was no longer doling out the punishments that they all deserved. And yet they still have thirty or so angels on staff. But who am I to question how the big guy runs the place, huh? Marie headed back out into the hall, and I looked back down at my first case of the day. > NAME OF SUPPLICANT: Domin-Ur > LOCATION: Ur, Mesopotamia > DATE: 1200 years after Creation > PRAYER/WISH: Region is experiencing drought, and crops are failing. SUPPLICANT asks for water for his farm so that he might better feed his family. I sighed. A pretty common one. But as God commanded, I had to be thorough. So I went through the information database and confirmed everything, then began filling in the blanks in my response template: > Dear **Mr. Domin-Ur**, > We have received your request for **additional water for your farm**. We apologize very much for the **drought in your region** and regret any inconvenience that may have caused you. I hope it will please you to know that I have **sent a rainstorm to that location. Your lands should be well-watered within five to seven business days.** > Additionally, I understand that you have now been dead for **7,221 years** due to **famine**. As a result, this action will not be subject to any additional follow-up prayers. I do hope you are enjoying the afterlife here with us. > Sincerely, > Department of Prayers and Wishes. I held up the letter and read it over once more. Not bad. I stamped it with our official seal and moved it over to my outbox with a satisfied grin. Being able to help people was probably the main reason that I'd chosen to work *here* of all places in Heaven. It just made the work so much more satisfying. *1 down, 1,996,655,125,163,879,653,235,901 to go*, I told myself. As Marie came in with another towering stack, I grabbed one more folder out of my inbox and started on my second request of the day. ---- I hope you enjoyed this story!

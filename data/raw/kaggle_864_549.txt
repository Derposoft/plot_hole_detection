GENESIS: Blink three time to track quest. &nbsp; I was dumbfounded. I had always been able to see my health, but now all of a sudden there was an experience bar and a mana bar. I noticed the quest start to shimmer, as if it was about to disappear. Not knowing how I might find it again, I quickly blinked three times. &nbsp; QUEST TRACKED *GENESIS* *Objective: Reach level 3* &nbsp; I had no idea what was going on, so I did what I do best in life, I ignored it. That was, until I committed some code changes to our server. &nbsp; *20XP* &nbsp; I watched as the number as it dissolved into silver dust and trickled down into the experience bar. And then I had an idea. I grabbed my lunch and flew to the break room. I threw my cold lunch into the microwave and punched the buttons for 2 minutes. The longest 2 minutes of my life. The microwave went off and I threw open the door and grabbed my lunch. Once it was out of the microwave, I got a nice 30XP for my efforts. *Not bad* I thought, halfway to Level 2. Seeing as it was only 10am, I threw out my lunch and went to talk to my boss to tell him I wasn't feeling well and needed to take the day off. Luckily he said it was alright and wished me well. &nbsp; *50XP* *LEVEL UP* *Deception increased* &nbsp; I had to stifle a laugh as I shut my boss' door. This was unbelievable, *looks like 200XP until Level 3* I smirked, the way thing were going, I'd reach that in the next couple of hours. So I spent those next few hours trying things out punching my punching bag at home, making food from scratch, making makeshift weapons. All of those gave me XP, but some things didn't, like eating the food I made or watching TV while I ate said food. Then sure enough, It appeared. &nbsp; *15XP* *LEVEL UP* *NEW SKILL POINT AVAILABLE* &nbsp; Huh, that was new. I started to think about how to use the skill point but before I could, I had a new objective. &nbsp; *GENESIS* *Objective: Blink 5 times to open skill tree* &nbsp; I did as it said and suddenly it was like using a VR headset. I looked around at the skills around me. *Blink twice to unlock skill* appeared in the center of my HUD. I looked around and settled on 'Novice Conjuration'. I blinked twice and the icon flashed in bright gold and I was returned to my kitchen, this time my mana bar was full. &nbsp; *QUEST COMPLETE - GENESIS* &nbsp; FIRST STEPS: Blink three time to track quest. &nbsp; I blinked three times. &nbsp; QUEST TRACKED *FIRST STEPS* *Objective: Conjure your first tool* &nbsp; This took me a while, but I eventually got it later that night when I conjured up a new toothbrush. It scared me because after hours of trying, I didn't expect this to actually work. &nbsp; *FIRST STEPS* *Objective: Conjure 10 items - 0/10* &nbsp; I smiled as I climbed into my bed. Suddenly my life went from working a boring office job to a new adventure. This was going to be fun.

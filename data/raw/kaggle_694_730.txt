**Private Journal of Pope Francis** **Entry 1** The Church is dying. The old generation refuses to see it, and the new generation has known nothing but decline. The select few - the old but not prideful see the slow death of it - the choking out of the truth. The Church is not dying naturally, oh no. Given free reign, the Lord's truth will only grow in radiance. No, the Church is being murdered, strangled. Killed by the media, new entertainment devices, new ways to pass the time, and of course, The Church itself is being poisoned from the inside. People are so drawn in to themselves that they stray further and further from the Light. They remember what religion has driven the minority to do - to kill, to hate, to rape, that they forget what the majority does: love and save. I cannot save it. Though it shames me to say it, I can do nothing. The Church was supposed be evolve with time, but is hasn't changed in the last 70 years. I cannot bring 70 years worth of change in less than ten. I implore the God, though we may be unworthy, to give us a Miracle. **Entry 2** Then God said, "let there be light," and there was light. It has happened. The Miracle. I curse myself even now for doubting, for falling into despair. The Lord helps his children: he always has, he always will. I never though it possible, but Disney, yes Disney the movie company has offered to purchase us, The Church. The deal is private for now of course, I can only imagine the media stink when this goes live, but for now only I and a select few know. The select who are like me: old but not full of pride. They see what this is: a chance for salvation. Modern industries like Disney are the kind of institutions that have contributed to our fall, so our only chance is to become one of them, to play their game. A game not of prayers and good faith, but of entertainment and accessibility. I doubt the Disney executives see it, but they are not purchasing us, we are infiltrating them. **Entry 3** The Negotiations are complete. There was some money involved, which I used to silence some of the dissenters withing the Church, but the real deal was the talk of rights. Every movie made by Disney would have a Catholic priest as an adviser. None of his suggestions would be mandatory, but the director would be obliged to listen. The executives had smiled when they heard. Thinking us fools. They were the fools. Priests had convinced people to change their way of life, what was convincing a director to make a slight adjustment to a film? Disney would have rights to present the material of the Church in any light, and the Church would legally sign away any recourse of heresy or libel. Again, this was just a benefit. The Church's image could hardly get worse. A dying patient would rather take the dangerous experimental drug rather than do nothing. **Entry 4** Busy. Managing Media. Meetings. Will convince them. Will obey the lord's will. **Entry 5** It has taken a year, but the deal has officially happened. The legal battles are over, the strife in the Church has...lessened. The media coverage however, has just intensified. Some fear it may be the end of the Church as we know it, but the Church was ending anyways. Either I have saved it, or just accelerated its demise. Time will tell. **Entry 6** The first movie released today. The first movie under the Catholic Disney, or the Disney Church, depending on who you're asking. It was about a bitter boy who lost his parents in war, and how he finds comfort in the form a nun who was excommunicated. Even I must say it was heartwarming to watch. Some of the dissenters are even coming around. Saying this wan't that bad of an idea after all. The movie is a huge hit, children love it, adults love it. Even the media has grudgingly admitted that it's one of the best movies Disney has ever released. And they say Miracles do not occur. **Entry 7** I have done it, I think. I have created a new Church, a new world. Now I can rest.

What the hell is this? **Jesse Black:** Hahahaha omg bring back meatballs **Aaron Daniels:** Haha Justin **Karen Jacobs:** What are you doing? Where are you? Is that IKEA? - Justin, Early 20's, Tall, skinny, shaggy blonde hair was gleefully grasping his phone while ducking and weaving in between rooms on the showroom floor of IKEA in his home of Columbus, Ohio. With a shit-eating grin, watches as his expansive friends list jumped into the chat on his livestream of his newest adventure. "Hey guys, I made it. Doors have been locked and most lights are out. It's dark as hell in here with no windows nearby. You thought they'd keep these things on. Can you all see me OK?" - **Candace Smith:** HAHAHAHAHAHA **Jesse Black:** Yes **Gary Rawles:** Omg **Candace Smith:** Ya **Gary Rawles:** Yes **Jesse Black:** BORK BORK IKEA BORKY BORK **Jesse Black:** LOL - With a smirk he shifted from quietly moving from place to place, to confidently walking with a boastful tempo on the main walkway through the rugs and linens. "It's now uh...... 9:45pm, I'm pretty sure everyone has left, and, uh, I'm now looking for what to do... Any suggestions anyone?" - **Aaron Daniels:** DUDE GO COOK SOMETHING **Karen Jacobs:** Go to the beds and test them out! **Candace Smith:** HAHA **Candace Smith:** No, are you stupid Aaron, the stoves don't actually turn on **Gary Rawles:** They're display models **Jesse Black:** Lol - Justin, illuminated only by his phone screen, decided to head to the lamp section nearby in hopes he could switch some on. Maybe there would be some portable ones he could bring with him, as he didn't think ahead to grab a flashlight. "Guys I'm going to get a light or lamp or something I can plug up with me. I have my power bank but no flashlight, maybe I could, I dunno, find a usb light." - **Aaron Daniels:** Haha ok yeah you do that. You're gonna get murdered **Karen Jacobs:** Lol Justin **Gary Rawles:** Really? No flashlight? Wtf **Aaron Daniels:** Wtf it's so dark there how can you see? **Aaron Daniels:** Lol - He makes his way into the lamp area and sees one or two that have been left on, he assumes to keep the employees from falling over themselves as they walk out after inspection. "Ok guys hold on a sec, I'm gonna prop my phone up here..." He switches his camera to back-facing and leans it against a small nightstand lamp up on a table, pointing to a dimly lit room with hundreds of sleeping lights. "Great. There we go. Ok one sec." - **Candace Smith:** No don't leave lol **Aaron Daniels:** Wat **Jesse Black:** JUSTIN COME BACK HAHA - After inspecting his camera to make sure it's focused on the whole of the room, he starts walking around to switch on the lights closest to him. The video of his live-stream begins to auto-focus to adjust to the new immediate light sources around. - **Gary Rawles:** Oh ok **Jesse Black:** That's betterrrrr **Gary Rawles:** Lol **Candace Smith:** Hey wait **Candace Smith:** Justin **Gary Rawles:** Are you turning on the lights near us, or the lights on the other side of the room? **Aaron Daniels:** What, there are lights over there now **Jesse Black:** IN THE CORNER?? **Jesse Black:** HEY JUSTIN **Gary Rawles:** Um - While Justin is bent over to turn on some nearby floor lamps, he hears some inconsistent 'clicks' out of the rhythm of the clicks he has been pressing. A jolt of adrenaline slaps him in the chest and a burst of sweat hits his brow. - **Gary Rawles:** Guys? Justin? Uh **Candace Smith:** Uh wtf **Aaron Daniels:** Lol srsly is this a joke **Jesse Black:** WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SEE THAT? **Jesse Black:** HOLY SHIT JUSTIN **Aaron Daniels:** JUSITN **Gary Rawles:** Justin **Jesse Black:** JUSTIN! - He slowly raises and sees that this mostly empty room has now been almost completely illuminated on the opposite corner from him. Standing in the dark-zone between his lights and the foreign ones in the back, he sees a silhouette of a person. A man? No, too small for that. A young woman. Two staggered steps back takes him right into a standing lamp, crashing along with him onto the concrete floor. The woman starts walking towards the phone, looks into the camera, and smiles. She is no more than 20, and wonderfully youthful in appearance. Rosy cheeks, wild curls, deep blue saucer-shaped eyes, pouting lips stretched to expose a warming smile. - **Candace Smith:** Wtf who is this **Jesse Black:** JUSTIN COME BACK **Aaron Daniels:** Hi. Who are you? **Jesse Black:** Wow, send nudes haha **Candace Smith:** Do you know Justin? - She looks towards the floor at the pile of crumpled boy and lamp, then back at the camera. "Don't worry, he'll be fine. I'm going to turn this off now though, but I promise you, He'll message you in a few minutes. If he's doesn't you're free to call the police." - **Candace Smith:** Wait **Jesse Black:** Hey JUSTIN *(cont.)*

On Tuesday, I drowned my genie. Or boiled him. I'm not sure. Dishwashers get really hot. On Wednesday I got a letter. It was a summons to court. Not regular court, but Celestial Court. Which, I guess, is where magical disputes are settled. Apparently they don't validate for parking. Said so right on the summons. People must ask about that a lot. On Thursday I visited my uncle Sven. He's a lawyer. "Tort!" he likes to yell when you say he's a lawyer. "Tort!" It's funny. Definitely say, "I hear you're a lawyer" if you ever meet Sven. You'll see. Anyway. I told Sven about the summons. He didn't get it. "Someone's suing you for doing your dishes?" "No, no!" I explained. "It's murder. I'm charged with murder." That didn't make it any clearer I guess. "You killed someone with your dishwasher?" "Yes. A genie. Named Ben." "You killed a genie?" "Named Ben." Sven puckered up his lips. That was his thinking pose. Classic lawyer move. "You had a genie? Like a magical creature, kind of genie? A lamp kind of genie?" "Yes," I said. "That's how he died. Inside the lamp. By drowning. Or boiling. Dishwashers get very hot." "How did you come to have a genie in a lamp?" "Goodwill." "That's...huh." "He gave me three wishes." Sven nodded. "And did you use them all? I suppose that will be important to establish in your trial." I shook my head. "No, I actually wished for infinite wishes." "You're not allowed to do that," said Sven, frowning. "Everyone knows that." "Ben didn't," I replied. "I think he was new, though." Sven nodded. "I'm starting to see a defense. Did Ben ever tell you *not* to drown or boil him?" I had to think on that for a while. "He said he wouldn't do any weird sex stuff." "But no warning that he was susceptible to drownings and/or boilings?" "No, sir." "This feels like negligence on his end." Sven looked at the summons once more. "I mean, you hate to blame the victim, but this was basically inevitable." "Definitely," I replied. "Same thing happened to my pet snake." Sven scratched his chin in a very lawyerly manner. "I would not mention that in court." "So you'll represent me?" I was feeling better already about accidentally murdering my magical wish slave. But Sven shook his head. "You're family. It wouldn't be right. And your mother would never forgive me if I didn't get you off. Plus, you see here, they don't validate parking, which really ought to be a crime, don't you think? Ah! Maybe we can counter-sue, assuming they don't execute you on the spot." "Would they do that??" Sven shrugged. "Tort." "I don't know what that means." On Friday I went to Celestial Court. I was beamed up via Celestial Particle Repulsion, so I'm still not sure where I was supposed to park. The courtroom was mostly see-through and starry. It felt like going to church in the clouds. I even wore a tie. The prosecution only had one piece of evidence, which was Ben's lamp. Ben had apparently disintegrated, which I definitely feel kinda bad about. "Did you bring any counsel?" asked the judge, who looked a little like the genie from *Aladdin* when the genie from *Aladdin* was an elephant. "Better. I brought the truth, your honor," I replied. "Which is that Ben killed himself and nothing is my fault." "You drowned him!" shouted the prosecution. "Objection!" I shouted back. "I'm pretty sure he boiled to death." "What's the difference?" "Glad you asked!" Things were going very well. I could tell because everyone was making that face where they're having a hard time believing how good someone is doing at their job. "If Ben boiled alive, would the lamp need to be hot or cold?" The prosecution sputtered. "Hot, obviously!" I pointed at the lamp. Checkmate. "And can you tell...is that lamp hot?" The prosecution howled. "No, obviously it isn't hot *right now*!" "Well." I cleared my throat. "If the lamp is not hot, then you must let me walk." "Was that a rhyme?" said the prosecution. "Definitely was," I said. "Do *hot* and *walk* rhyme?" asked the judge. "No," sneered the prosecution. "They don't even end in the same letter." "Well now, strictly speaking, that's not how rhymes are defined," said the judge. And on and on it went. Eventually I just left and went home. On Saturday I went back to Goodwill and bought a new incense holder. Nobody was living in this one, so that's been nice.

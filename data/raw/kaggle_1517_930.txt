Originally, it was great, just fuckin' great. Just imagine it, everywhere you go and you're plugged in. People are giving you the nod like you're the man, because you are the man. You come through the door and folks are snapping to. Bossman coming. I don't know how it started, I don't know why it started, but it happened. Like the cosmos just decided to let me have my way just to see what happened. Sure, I took advantage a few times. Helped myself to a fry or two at McDonalds. Just walked right in and the the manager started bowing and scraping because 'Regional' was here for a 'Quality Assurance' run. All of a sudden I got all the fries I want and then some. The damn guys even brought out that special Szechuan sauce from Rick & Morty. Bananas man. But here's where shit started to go sideways, when everywhere you go you've got the job, it starts to feel like a job. Gets to be a real drag. I walk into the supermarket and all of a sudden some lady with orange juice all over her clothes is yelling at me because they didn't get the clean up on aisle two done fast enough. Like that's my fucking problem. Well guess what? They're making it my problem. Everywhere I go I'm getting grief. And the perks ain't so perky neither. I walked down to Gamestop trying to get the pre-sale on Red Dead (yeah, I do the presale shit still, get off my case) so I can get the limited edition Red Dead Bobblehead and they're telling me that corporate policy says I can't take advantage of it. Says I gotta go through the company submissions process, whatever the hell that means. I just want a bobblehead. I don't want to fill out form 23-A. Give me my shit already. And don't even get me started on when I walked into the DMV to get my license renewed. Holy shit those guys are operating like the ninth circle of bureaucratic hell and the second I slip through they're all, "Well hello Mr. Devil Sir, we need you to concoct a new circle of hell and approve Red Asphalt 23." BTW, those people have a super weird fetish around making people wait in lines. I'm not a shrink (unless I happen to wander into a shrink's office), but there's something seriously wrong with them. So yeah, turned out this gift is a real nightmare, free fries aside. So I've just decided we gotta escalate this matter straight to the top. Luckily I get to be at the top if I manage to get to the right location. Just gotta be in the biggest room so I can be the biggest badass. Only problem is that I'm in California and the Oval Office is a long fucking way away. Oh, fly a plane you say? Great idea! Why didn't I think of that? I remember now, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FLY A PLANE. You think I can just stroll on board a 747 without being shoved in the captain's seat? Yeah, not gonna happen. I mean, if I could just be a flight attendant it'd be cool. I'd just dump a bunch of booze on first class and the knock out some Z's until we landed, but that's the problem with my situation. It's straight to the top every time I walk in. Now I get why the bosses get paid the big bucks, cause it's a non-stop shit fiesta. So I gotta take the long route. Problem is that even the long route has got some problems. Say I take my car, every time I get to a toll booth I gotta get out and pay myself and wave myself through. Stop for gas? Whelp, time to learn how to operate a gas station 'cause I'm the one in charge. I thought maybe a train, it seems like those dudes are just sleeping in the front of the car the entire time anyways, but then I started looking into the safety requirements and how often people commit suicide by driving in front of a train and I don't want that shit on my conscience. I've been putting a lot of time into planning this trip so I can get this monkey off my back. Got this giant map laid out from Google where I gotta plot street by street so I can avoid as many responsibilities as possible. Never thought avoiding a job would feel so much like a damned job. I feel like there's a life lesson in here somewhere, but I sure as hell can't figure it out what it is. Must be above my pay grade. Snort. Right now it's gonna take me 32 days to cross the states. That's with me avoiding all toll roads, major cities (where I become the mayor and then have to wait for a security escort), and just about everything else I can think of. At least the fast food will be free, though I gotta say Mickey D's sounds a lot less appetizing now that I know how the sausage is made. Let's just say there's a price we all pay when we want a hamburger in under a minute. Big long hassle all so I can get to the Oval Office, declare myself unemployable and get on with my life. Wish me luck folks, and if we happen to cross paths, get back to fucking work and leave me alone. **Platypus out.** **Want more peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

At first, it was called, 'The Miracle of the Modern Age'. Some talk show host must have decided that was too long, so it was changed to, 'The Modern Miracle'. That was too long as well, (and probably too on-the-nose) so it was changed to 'The Sign'. Or 'The Message.' That was probably more appropriate. Grandmaster Flash would have been proud. On December 25th, 2019, everyone, around the entire world, received a text. Those that didn't have a cell, received a call. Those that didn't have a phone, received a letter. Those that couldn't read, received a phone that had a message on it. And so on, all the way down. Everybody got the message somehow. The message was simple: **Come to Me on April 12, 2020.** **Piazza San Pietro, 00120 Citta del Vaticano, Vatican City.** It was translated into whatever language the receiver spoke, even the dead languages. Four simple words, folowed by a date, followed by an address. Except it wasn't simple at all. Because that date was Easter Sunday. And that address was St. Peter's Basilica. The world went insane. Flights to Italy were immediately overbooked for nineteen years. People started walking to Rome. World leaders spoke in hushed tones. Some said The End was coming; some said it was the most elaborate hoax ever. Attempts to track down the sender were fruitless, leading to nothing but air. People committed mass suicide. A crusade was nearly started. It seemed everyone in the world had finally gone mad. Except for me. My text said: **Come to Me on April 12, 2020. 367 Mulberry Lane, Niobrara County, Wyoming.** What? I tried showing it to other people, but they just laughed. "Why you faking the message, Chuyo? Everyone knows we gotta go to the Vatican!" Thing is, they were right to laugh. Fakes were sprouting up everywhere, with the most popular telling everyone to go to Area 51. A large group of people had already pledged to go there instead of Rome. But I was just nervous. Why was I the only one to get a different address? Was I not worthy or something? Why? Maybe I wasn't the best person, or the most religious, but c'mon! Even serial killers rotting in prison had gotten a call! I kinda grew depressed. I tried booking a flight to Rome, but the travel agent just laughed. "If you wanna get to Rome from Mexico, them your name better be Carlos Slim, 'cuz you ain't gettin' there otherwise. Guess you gonna have to watch the Coming from your basement, Chuyo." At that moment, I resolved to go that place in Wyoming. It wasn't what I wanted, but by God, I had to do *something.* I set out the very next day. Immigration was easy. Restrictions had become lax after America started hemorrhaging people to Europe. The President had already left. I got in on a tourist Visa, and headed up to Wyoming, hitchhiking most of the way. I got robbed twice, shot at once, had to sleep in a ditch more times than I'd care to count, and spent one miserable night in a Colorado jail. But I got there in the end. Only to find out 367 Mulberry Lane didn't exist. I had been tricked after all. I just gazed at the empty space between 365 and 369, and broke down crying. I won't lie, I thought of ending it right then. But I got over it and thought of going back to Mexico. But what did I have there? Mother was dead, and she hadn't even known who my father was. I resolved to stick it out until Easter, then hike back. The fateful day finally came, and I celebrated by getting drunk. I could barely even stand. I just stared at the empty space that was 367 Mulberry Lane, while all the world leaders piled into the Vatican. The sun slowly went down. I took another swig, and laughed, realizing this would be the first Easter I'd spend outside of a church. I threw the bottle at the empty space. It clattered against something. A door. That hadn't been there before. It was filled with light, and the inscription on it simply read: **INRI**. My hand shaking, I opened the door. The world was bathed in light. # BE READY, MY SON. I stepped out of the light, blinking rapidly as I stepped into the dark. Wyoming was gone. In its place were million upon millions of people of all races, colors, ages, staring up at me. I stared down at them. All was silent. And a voice boomed from the heavens, from the ground, from everywhere. # HE IS RISEN! Everyone went down on one knee, and shouted, **"HE IS RISEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"** I stared down at them. My beard itched. My skin crawled. I felt nauseous. But I knew why I was here. What I had to do. Where I had to go. Seemed I'd managed to get to Rome, after all. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; *Not my usual work, at all. But I thought I'd give it a shot. Please tell me what you think.*

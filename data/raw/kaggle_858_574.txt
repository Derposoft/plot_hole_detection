The simulated battle ended and the abducted human soldier slumped with fatigue and confusion, looking at the unfamiliar surroundings of the holodeck. "What happened with the sim? Why was the human able to withstand so many waves of enemies?" the Thakdarian commander demanded of his scientists, slamming his second and third forearms onto his desk and scaring several of those clustered around a datapanel, pointing and arguing about the results of the test. "Sir, the results simply don't make sense. Somehow, as his enemies grew more numerous and intelligent, the subject's performance improved. It seemed that the closer he got to exhaustion or danger, his metabolic rate, circulatory, and respiratory levels became elevated," the scientist pointed to each of the relevant points of data in turn, "but his reaction time, motor function, and even his apparent critical thinking speed increased to several times his baseline." "Have we underestimated these bipeds so utterly?" the commander growled, "Their medical technology is centuries behind ours! They don't even use energy weapons! They can't possibly have created a battledrug better than anything our own kind have." The scientists moved as a group, shrinking away from the decorated officer. "Sir, we woke him up in a simulated earth town with only his clothes and weapon. He has not consumed or injected anything on his own and tests of the atmosphere in the holodeck show no chemical compounds that would cause this behavior on inhalation. We also noticed no codewords that would awaken hypnotic training," he said, pointing at the translated audio recording of the subjects colorful language. "We cannot explain this behavior except by speculation." The commander sat back in his chair and looked again at the human, who already seemed to be recovering from the simulation and was starting to explore his surroundings. "By all means, speculate," he said. The Thakdar scientists quietly conferred among themselves, in some cases arguing quietly and each giving his or her own thoughts on what happened. After a few minutes, the commander coughed and several scientists started and turned. A datapad clattered to the floor. "Sir, the human appears to be able to produce a natural drug during times of stress. We can pinpoint when it was released during the sim, starting with the moment he heard the first energy weapon fire in the distance, then each time a new wave of enemies was created." The scientist had changed the main datascreen to a series of graphs showing vital signs during the simulation, and was pointing out moments when the human seemed at once the most stressed and, perplexingly, the most effective. "The last spike was when the simulation ended and the simulated town disappeared, revealing that he was in an unfamiliar place." As the scientist pointed at the end of the simulation, he noticed that the graphs were still recording and the human's vitals were elevated as though he were entering combat again. As one, the Thakdarian research unit looked into the sim chamber only to see the human subject pointing his weapon at the commander and baring his teeth in a mockery of glee. Through the glass, they saw the human's mouth moving. A moment later, the translator spoke. "Take me to your leader." _______________________________________________________ Edit: This is my first attempt at writing here. I hope everyone likes it!

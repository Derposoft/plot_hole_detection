A flame wavered in the distance. Flimsy, sputtering, like one of the many disposable Zippos I purchased from the local Walmart. My Light couldn't be any more pathetic. *A* *little* *brighter* *would* *be* *nice.* A second flame sputtered into life beside the first. Its flames flickered, nearly dying as if threatened by a light breeze. Whatever this place was, it was taunting me. *I* *need* *to* *see,* *goddamn* *it!* My hands coiled around a plastic barrel, soldered together with another one of similar mass. My fingers traced its edges, flicking lightly over the cracked lens. A fat lot of good children's binoculars would do me in the relentless night. *Very* *funny.* When I was on Death's door, I expected him to answer. Now that I'm here, he greets me with an endless torment of wishes half granted. *You* *lettin'* *me* *in,* *or* *what?* A door appeared. Its simple wood frame was painted white. Ancient glyphs spiraled around a hand etched in crayon. *You're* *such* *a* *bastard.* The crayon hand curled its fingers. All except the longest, a colourful beacon sending me a glorious fuck you. *Fine.* *I'll* *rot* *out* *here.* *See* *what* *I* *care.* I turned away from the door, squatting down to run my hands over the ground. Baby bottom smooth. It felt gross. Dad probably would've cracked a joke about how my bottom was never smooth, just crusty. Mom probably would've slapped him. "Dave!" she'd yell, her laughter betrayed by the smirk on her face. I liked her when she smirked like that. It reminded me of better days. A glove flopped onto my shoulder. I waited, expecting another joke at my expense. But it just sat there, its cracked leather skin peeling away. Air rushed through my nostrils. I don't care anymore. If this asshole won't let me in, then I'll just wait out here. I'm used to waiting. My whole life has been waiting. Waiting to be old enough to go to school. Waiting to be old enough to read and write. Waiting to graduate high school so I could move out and grow up. Waiting for love to find me, or for me to find it. Waiting for my mom and dad to split up and get on with being happy. Waiting for dad to come back from the hospital. Waiting for him to open his eyes. The glove rubbed my shoulder. I held it tight, clinging to the small shred of comfort its decaying form provided me. Leave it to Death to have a dying glove to comfort the newly deceased. *Can* *I* *please* *come* *in?* *I* *miss* *him* *so* *much.* I turned, facing the door. The hand had faded, replaced by a silent, cackling skull. **All** **you** **had** **to** **do** **was** **ask.** The door opened, a rectangle of pure white. A smile spread across my face. I walked through the door, clutching the worn glove the entire way. _____________________________________________________ Thank you so much for reading!

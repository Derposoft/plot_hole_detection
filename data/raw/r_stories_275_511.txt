Abusive parents by t2_43z9la6g

i used to live in  San Francisco  California  when i was 9 years old in 2011 i used to have a friend called Emily , she was 9 but i was 2 months older . now i was a very mature kid i understood when we were in danger and what i had to do , one day i was invited to Emily's birthday so i went to visit Emily her ''mother''  welcomed me into the house , when i entered her house i noticed that nobody was in the house except a drunk man sleeping on the couch looking at the TV and a stage like piano it was big but not huge , i was excited since i loved playing a piano and listened to people playing a piano mainly my favorite was  FÃ¼r Elise" by Beethoven , i asked Emily's mother "who can play on that piano" she answered with a "nobody" with a huge creepy smile on her face  i was shocked since i realized that this isnt Emily's mother , i only noticed this when i saw her creepy smile on her very pale face . i RAN to the door then i fell down and the women locked the door so i stood and ran up the stairs . i couldn't do anything since i was a young child and she was more powerful so i ran up found a room with an opened door i ran as fast as i could and fortunately there was a lock in the door i ran into the room and locked the door i took like 30 seconds to regain my breathe "i was still young" when i looking at the back of the room i saw a bed with someone sleeping on it , i pulled the blanket and saw a little girl with like 3 bruises on her legs and covered with scars then i quickly realized that her parents are insane and abusive i quickly woke her up and opened the window and shouted "HELP HELP" many people saw me and did nothing except one old man who knew the parents are insane so he called the cops , meanwhile the women tried entering the room by kicking down the door fortunately she couldn't do it because their doors were heavy and couldn't be broken into easily so i used her own house against her . i waited for 5 minutes until the cops arrived and called the ambulance to get this little poor girl some help . the cops held a party for me because apparently the people were wanted criminals and i a little kid solved a mystery none of the cops could solve . the sheriff praised me and told me i had a bright future ahead of me and told me not to waste it i laughed and left . i later asked  my mom about the man who was laying on the couch and she told me the man was arrested . i grew up to be a praised detective.

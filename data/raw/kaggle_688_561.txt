All the candles in the room went out. Smoke boiled from the small pentagram carved into the table, curling into an ever thickening serpent of fog. Scarlet lightning arced within the cloud, and cast the shadowed faces of the various figures around the table in sharp relief. As the shadows of the room deepened and the coiling mist stopped rising into the air, a voice spoke from within. "Which foul sorcerer has dared to pull me into this mortal world from my slumber...." it rumbled. Red lightning licked the top of the table as the cloud pulsed with power. Eyes seemed to stare out at the people around the table, specifically at one particularly scrawny kid clutching some sort of book. The kid coughed slightly, and rose his hand into the air. The spirals of smoke pulled inward and became darker, as red eyes materialized out of the mist and peered at him. They looked slightly confused. "If you were the unholy necromancer who summoned me forth, speak your demands so I may be rid of this pathetic form..." it rumbled at him. "Do you wish for power over your enemies...," it growled, and a massive sword materialized out of smoke and scarlet electricity. It hovered above the table, before melting into a pair of pistols, before drifting down into the table to explode in the vague shape of a mushroom cloud. "..Or perhaps riches untold...," and fountains of rubies poured out of the dark smoke. They clattered loudly onto the wood in front of the kid with the notebook, who looked thoroughly unseduced by the fortune. The voice paused for a moment and the rubies dissolved into shadow. It then spoke again, a slight entreaty in its voice now; "..Or for immortality, and a life to best death itself...," as a black skull formed around its bloodred eyes, then cracked and shattered into motes of darkness. The kid looked slightly amused. "No, not really," the kid said. He reached to his side, hefted a thick book onto the table, and slid it towards the demon. Its form shrank slightly as it peered at the title, then looked up at the kid in bewilderment. "You want me... to make the contents of the book real?" it asked. The kid shrugged. "I suppose in our imaginations, yeah." A girl sitting across the table from him piped up; "We don't want ACTUAL minotaurs rampaging through, but definitely, like, in the story we do." The demon shook its form in disbelief. "No mortal has ever asked for this. To be clear, if I play a character in this... game... you will release me?" "No, no we don't want you to be a character," the kid said. He tossed a small object towards the cloud, and a spectral hand formed instantly and caught it. The scarlet eyes gazed down at a roughly round shape with numbers on it. A die, with twenty sides. The kid grinned. "We want you to DM our game." EDIT: Fixed some grammar/spelling mistakes.

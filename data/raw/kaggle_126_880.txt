*I probably shouldn't have gotten onto this flight* thought Tommy, as he woke up in Pyongyang. *But he's the best player in my clan I can't get on his bad side.* Tommy grabbed his carry on luggage, and yawned mightily. He thanked a few of his flight attendants, who only smiled shyly at him, and whispered amongst themselves. He walked out of the plane to the runway. Tommy froze when he saw the leader of "Best Korea" standing there, with a whole entourage, and fully armed military escort. "*Best friend!*" shouted Kim Jong-un. He smiled like it was the happiest day of his life, and handed Tommy a box of chocolates in a heart shaped box. "You my best friend now, since Dennis reft." Tommy didn't know what to do. He stared around with wide eyes, and bowed a couple of times. "Th-*kof kof kof*-thank you so much great leader," said Tommy. He bowed a couple more times. "I appreciate your hospitality, these look delicious." Kim Jong-Un gestured that Tommy should walk with him, smiling all the while. Tommy obliged. They went over to an area with some people standing in a line, and crying horribly for some reason. Kim Jong-Un hit Tommy on the shoulder with the back of his hand. Like a pimp slap, but for your shoulder. "Hey man remembah dat *time* man, remembah dat *triple collateral headshot* to win that team deathmatch man you keeled all those people man ahhh *man*," said Kim Jong-un. "*Best* day *ever* best friend, so *fun.* Let's *re-live* that man, look over *there* man." Kim Jong-Un pointed at the crying people, lined up in a row. "I see them?" said Tommy. A soldier handed Kim Jong-Un a sniper rifle, and bowed several times. Kim Jong-Un looked at it, and smiled real bright. Great toy. "I try," said Kim Jong-Un. *Oh God*, thought Tommy. *I 360 no-scoped I remember that shot, oh shit.* Kim Jong-Un did a full revolution with the rifle in his hand. Tommy ducked, while everybody else only cringed. He stabilized himself after the spinning, and took a step to get his balance. He shook his head, and smiled real bright. He took twenty full seconds to line up the sight. **BANG.** "FUCK," Tommy shouted. He looked away, then threw up beside the runway. Nothing but airline food, some weird meat and a piece of bread. It tasted like bile. Kim Jong-Un smiled, and handed the rifle to Tommy. "So much *fun*, now *you* try too best friend," said Kim Jong-Un. Tommy got into fits of coughing, and politely declined. "I'm sorry great leader I just c-*kof kof kof kof*-" "I *said*," said Kim Jong-Un. He shoved the gun into Tommy's hands. "I said now *you try* best friend, you get it? My English good?" "It's great," said Tommy. He did an okay symbol, and put his hands on his knees, wheezing. "It's so great, so great merciful leader." "*Good*." He handed it to him, like a gift. Tommy slowly took the rifle. They lined up a whole row of other crying people, right next to the bodies of the recently collateraled. Tommy breathed in and out hard, and tried to steady his hand. There was the man at the front, pleading for mercy, in his line of sight. Tommy's hands were shaky, but his aim was true. He felt the burn of acid in his throat. He turned to Kim Jong-Un and fired at his face. A toy flag came out reading *Awww man*. The flag waved by Kim Jong-Un's face. It tickled him. Soldiers all around seized Tommy, and threw him to the ground. They tazed him too, just for fun. "Wrong *choice* best friend," said Kim Jong-Un. He kneeled beside Tommy's shaking body, slobbering while being tazed. He made a *tsk tsk tsk* noise, and stopped smiling. "Wish you didn't do that *choice*. But you still my bro though okay former best friend? Okay cool." They stopped tazing him, and handed Tommy a controller. A bunch of soldiers ran out with a TV screen, and a game console. Everything was all ready loaded. Tommy was shivering in horror. "1 V 1 best friend," said Kim Jong-Un. He smiled at Tommy with delight. "Play for your *life*." Edit: Whoa happy you guys enjoyed this post! I'd love to reply to all the comments but I don't want to push stories below any further away from visibility. That was a very interesting conversation below on accents, I based my perspective on his accent a lot on how Kim Jong-Il spoke in Team America: World Police with some influence from Ken Jeong's character Mr. Chow in the Hangover, I assure you there was no ill-will towards the general Korean accent. I've briefly been to South Korea and it's a beautiful country with awesome people. I had a scare in Seoul airport recently from an allergic reaction and thankfully I received help fast enough from some kind people there to reach the pharmacy and for it to not be too much of a problem haha You can find links to other samples of my writing in every letter of this [W]( https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/37qidy/wp_write_a_synopsis_of_50_shades_of_grey_in_the/) [O]( https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/61frvu/wp_you_pull_off_your_headphones_and_the_whole/dfe9obk/?context=3)[R]( https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3z3lb0/cw_write_a_story_with_as_many_plot_twists_as_you/cyj2uac/?context=3) [D]( https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/37h9pn/wp_george_washington_accidentally_traveled_to_the/crn490l/?context=3).

It observed him with cold eyes, one of its wings protruded at an awkward angle. Even as Reed's shadow loomed over the raven it made no signs of distress, made no plea for its life. It did not cry out in anger at its alleged executioner. It simply observed his approach, an unmistakable intelligence flaring up behind its pitch-black eyes. "Looks like a broken wing," Reed said out loud, even though it was just him and the raven. To his surprise the bird nodded and looked up at his eyes, seemingly implying, "Help." The raven slapped Reed's hand away dismissively with its beak when it became clear he was going to wrap the bird in his thick blue scarf. It glared at him with indignation, it pointed its beak at his right shoulder. Reed said, "You-- you want to ride on my shoulder, with a broken wing?" And the raven crowed once in affirmation. Reed helped the strange creature up on his shoulder and started biking slowly, the Raven positioned himself to reduce wind from slamming into its broken wing, but judging from the talons that dug into him, it wasn't very effective. Strange calls echoed throughout the sky as he made his way out of the park, the sound of numerous flapping wings interrupted his thoughts, he looked over his free shoulder. A squad of crows, probably around three dozen. "Looks like murder is in the air," Reed chuckled to himself, the raven pecked him in his ear, "Ow, quit that!" The raven crowed into his ear and continued pecking, "Stop it, I'm sorry, alright?" When one of the crows flew in-front of him, trying to disrupt his trajectory, it became clear that the raven did not want to punish him for his bad tastes, it tried to make him go faster. A lot faster. "What's going on?" Reed was flabbergasted, he was under attack by a bunch of birds! Reed found it strange, but something in the eyes of the raven seemed to say, "Get me out of this, and you'll be rewarded." Reed stood up on his bike and started pedalling like his life depended on it, he swerved off-road around a couple of tall pines, he could feel the raven's talons dig into his flesh. The raven crowed with ire Reed did not expect out of a bird, their assailants crowed right back at them. "Out of the way," Reed shouted at a couple who had stopped to look at the macabre scene approaching, "watch out!" He biked right between them. When Reed looked back, he thought there must be at least a hundred crows now. Reed leaped out of his bike with one hand held on the raven to support it against the violent ejection. They narrowly made it through the doors to his apartment house before the loud crowing outside blotted out the sound of cars, he heard beaks clattering against the hard-wood of the door. "*Who* are you?" Reed asked with his back against the door, panting in exhaustion. Reed's eyes widened when the raven spoke back to him in perfect English, "King." ***** Thank you for reading! **EDIT:** [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/dh704v/wp_it_turns_out_that_all_birds_share_a_common/f3m6nf6/?context=3)

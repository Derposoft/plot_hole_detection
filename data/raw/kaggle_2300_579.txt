> God has been watching as human technology gets more advanced. With each advancement it becomes easier for them to kill each other. In order to save his creation he adds an 11th commandment. "Thou Shalt not use any form of projectile weapon, melee only you cowards.". Are you kidding me God? **What?** Thou Shalt not use any form of projectile weapon? There are so many problems with that! **I decreed it though, so it must be perfect!** Don't give me that! Don't you realize how obsolete this is? Thou Shalt Not Kill is already a thing! Are we supposed to conclude that you've taken that commandment back? **Ah... No. It was merely to...** And if you really have such a problem with projectile weapons, you should've just never made us invent them! **Look. I have a hands off policy...** And what? You make this commandment *now* of all times, just because of modern weapons, excluding all of the unfair projectile warfare that existed in the past? **I'll have you know that none of them were nearly as...** The ancient sling was functionally identical to the gun, right down to using bullets, yet you didn't have this argument when those were introduced... Now apparently we can't use those either? **This has been the product of much deliberation my part... I alway thought there was a problem with the sling but...** What? Did you just forget about David and Goliath? **huh?** So it's ok and honorable when the future king of Israel does it, but when a regular old joe uses some contemporary projectile weapon in self defense instead, suddenly it's a sin? **That was differen...** Without projectile weapons, it'll just be the strong picking on the weak again! Haven't you heard how they're the great equalizer? **Equal or not, the cost is...** By taking away this, but keeping the differences in physique you've separated humans into, it's like you've just completely dropped you notion that "the weak shall inherit"! **But the cost in human lives...** Have you ever heard the term: "There are no winners in a knife-fight?" **... What?** Melee Warfare won't be much better. This is an ineffective solution at it's best... **For this one at least there are a ton of statistics...** If you wanted a generally non-lethal war-fare, ban everything but tranquilizers! Remove the hatred within humanity's heart! Or make people more generally durable! Do literally anything except this stupid half-assed measure! **I mean...** The people you want to follow such a commandment won't even listen to something like this! They'll keep doing what they always do anyways, but suddenly you've unbalanced the playing field even more! **...** This is why hardly anyone ever truly believes in you anymore you colossal omnipresent prick! **...** **... Are you done Pope? All out of your system?** ... Yeah, I think it is. **You know I work in mysterious ways don't you?** Yeah, I got it. Who am I to question the divine plan? **If it makes you feel any better, most of those complaints of yours are entirely valid.** But you got to do it anyway, for some small quirk of events far off into the future, right? **Now you've got it.** This really isn't the best solution. You know that right? **If you have any ideas of your own, feel free to implement them. You doing or not doing so is also part of my plan...** Alright; (Damn it) I'll go and announce the new Commandment...

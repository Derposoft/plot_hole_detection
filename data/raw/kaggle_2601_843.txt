Fate is a loop, winding in on itself. Each end is a new beginning. I know this truth, because I have seen it in the souls that travel this earth beside me. Some souls are newly born, fresh from the forge of this reality, untainted by the past. They are rare, these pure slates. The actions of this first life shall place their soul on a path, one that will resist change. The imprint of the lives before shall mark the lives to come. I can sense the taint. Feel it viscerally with every sense. I taste it in the back of my throat. I smell it on their skin. I see it in their eyes. I know from whence they came, and this knowledges tells me where they will soon go. It is not a chosen thing, this ability. It is imbued within me, burgeoning in my youth and reaching full bloom now that I am a man. I have thought it a gift at times, believing the ability an edge in my interactions with those around me. But I fear it blinds as often as it allows me to see. I cannot separate the taint of the past from the present. Each interaction is colored by these perceptions. I judge the book by its cover, and I am impoverished for it. I did not realize this until I awoke into the fullness of my power. When my ability to sense became an ability to read. I could delve into the past rather than merely perceive its effects upon the soul. Only when my eyes were fully open did I understand how the ability had impacted me. All those who surrounded me bore the mark of nobility, great men and women descended from great lines. Old souls all, because their taint gave me a sense of security and safety compared to the pure souls that mystified me in their lack of projection. I had chosen my company with purpose, but without goal. The actions had been unconscious, guided by extra sense. Upon reflection, it seems only natural that one would be guided to those that provided them with the greatest sense of comfort. One does not befriend another with an unseemly stench or a disfavored appearance. One gravitates toward those that elevate themselves. I have simply added another dimension to the assessment all others make. But I have refrained from introspection. I have never dared peer within. I have provided myself with rationalizations. Explanations for the failure to delve. I assured myself that if something was wrong, I would have noticed it. But if the stench is your own, do you still perceive it? What sort of man was I? I kept the company of the noblest of lines. Great men and woman who have accomplished much in the service of their people. Why did they find pleasure in my company? It was not because they saw me as I saw them. They could not perceive as I did. I had discerned my separation from others in this regard long ago, largely through a collection of confrontations spurred by incautious remarks and other embarrassing lapses in judgement. No, I saw them for kings and queens, but they saw me merely as a companion. Why should we be interconnected? I looked upon the mirror. I stared back. I was no stranger to my own appearance, but I had never attempted to search beneath the exterior. I stared at my own eyes, which peered back at me. At first, I could sense nothing. The utter lack of a reaction led me to the conclusion I was a pure soul. I was immediately disappointed, somehow disgusted that I was fresh from the forge while those I traveled with enjoyed the mastery of the ages. I was a neophyte among wizened spirits, and I was shamed for it. But the initial impression was not the final one. The top layer merely resisted the effort to be pulled back. The veneer clung to me, desiring to maintain its facade for a moment longer. But I could see the cracks now, could sense that something lay beneath. I focused my attention deeper, drawing the slumbering depths toward the surface. The mirror tremored and then cracked along the edges, though my image in the center remained undisturbed. No. Not undisturbed. It had changed. The pale blue of my eyes glinted and swirled, filling with black. A halo of dark slowly grew above, resolving into an abyssal crown atop my head. The images of the past came to me then, my own taint now laid bare. I was an old soul. An ancient. A hunter. A consumer. A harvester. I knew now what I was. I knew now why the great lines clustered around me. I understood the connection. A great soul required a test. It required a crucible that burned away the weaknesses and tempered the soul to greater strengths. I was that test. They were the heroes. And I was their adversary. **Platypus OUT.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

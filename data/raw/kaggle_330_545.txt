The collector's whip ripped through the air and lashed the human's back. A trickle of red ran down the man's skin, dripping down onto the parched desert floor. "Please," Iu-iu begged, "I can't go on." "That is your prerogative, but if you fall human, know that you will never get back up." The collector smiled, his black, jagged teeth dipping out of his mouth. Iu-iu stumbled back into line of men and women, and placed his blistered hands around the thick rope. The huge brick moved onwards, soon reaching the great structure's shadow. The collector watched, satisfied. This was his favourite part of the Re-Culture - where his race would step in to help put humanity on the *right track*. For a thousand more years, he would be held as a God. Worshipped and adulated by the pathetic race around him. Then, after another five thousand years, the planet would be ready to harvest. The brick was almost by the structure when Iu-iu fell. The collector ran his long tongue over his lips as he walked toward the body. He bent down, and in a single swift motion, snapped the man's neck. Then, he hoisted him over his shoulder and took him toward a nearby chamber, well hidden under the sand. He would feast well tonight. --- "Captain," said first officer Kate Robins, "we've found another planet." Captain Richardson leaned down to the - now lit - monitor on the arm of his chair. "Looks a lot like home - just a little greener. What stage of development is this?" "From the weather formations and the amount of ice remaining, the computer estimates 3000bc. We'll know more once we enter the atmosphere and can run some tests." "3000bc?" Richardson repeated. Kate nodded. "This'll be the first planet we've found anywhere near that period," he said, stroking his chin. "I wonder what's going on down there." "It's the start of the ancient Egyptian period," butted in Piraino, the ill-tempered archaeologist that they'd been forced to take with them. "But I'd much prefer we found a planet a little more advanced." "I thought you were into old stuff. I heard that's why you married Elizabeth." Pirano glared at the captain, wondering for the hundredth time, how he'd possibly made it to that rank. "I'm kidding, Pirano - lighten up," said the captain, raising his open hands. "I am into old *stuff* - but we won't find an explanation for the cloned biospheres in the past. A version of Earth more advanced than our own, however, might be able to tell us." "You never know what we'll find down there, Pirano," replied Richardson. "Captain," Kate said, there's... something *odd* down there." "Odd? How so?" "You're not going to believe this, but we're detecting a hell of a lot of radiation in the location of what would eventually become Alexandria, Egypt." "Radiation?" "That's not all. There's some kind of neutron device down there." "*What!*" Pirano burst out. "A neutron *drive?*" "That can't be right," mused Richardson. "I've run the tests - three times. It's right." Richardson let out a deep breath. "Better take us down. "Somewhere uninhabited," he added. "We can't risk interfering with their development." --- Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/6kg7yp/the_collectors_part_2/ Part 3: https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/6kgt91/the_collectors_part_3/ Part 4: https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/6khu39/the_collectors_part_4/ Part 5: https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/6kiifw/the_collectors_part_5/

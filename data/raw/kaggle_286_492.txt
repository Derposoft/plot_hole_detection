The table is set, the candles are lit, and this is going to be the greatest use of $400 ever. The male is waiting, suit far too tight for his upper body stretching in anticipation. He has this look in his eyes as if to say, "At least I don't have to shit on anyone," and I, too, have that look. But burrowed in that look; deep inside its gooey guts like a caramel chocolate is joy - Oh wonderous joy. The woman arrives, femme fatale in appearance and struts over to the man. The way she moves, Christ, a succubus in hell hasn't got a chance to be hotter than that. She sits, a smirk splintering across her face like venom, and speaks. "Hello Lance," Even mountains would melt in the aura of her voice, dripping out of her in such a sultry manner I found myself falling in love with two words. "I'm glad we have a moment to relax, these last few weeks have been... *stressful*" "One way to say that, Susan," he replies, becoming the physical embodiment of masculinity. He lazily brushes his fingers through his thick brown beard, before leaning forward. "I've been so pent up trying to get the office sorted. I need a way to blow off some steam." "I've been bent over the cabinets for weeks trying to sort everything," her lips smack when she finishes the last syllable, and the left side of her smile rises. Small, subtle, and charming. "It's the way I like you," he states. The power and commandment in his voice make me completely aware as to why women like to call their partners 'Daddy'. I want to call him Daddy. "Do you want any more breadsticks, sir?" I turn, a waitress. I bite, "No, I am fine, I am wonderful, please leave me alone, I have important business to attend to." I turn back; they're walking out the door. Oh no. The prostitutes are off to have sex already. Why can't they just keep it in their pants, I need this, fuck. I stand and wipe some breadsticks dust off my lap, and sigh. Oh well, I got what I needed. I walk out the door, a buffet of surprise knocking the wind out of me, as two familiar faces staring at me. "Hey Lachlan," Lance says, not prostitute Lance, real Lance. "We didn't see you at the meeting. Management said you had somewhere to be," "Yeah, yeah," I calmly speak, "Lunch with some clients." I look at the two of them. "So, what are you two lovebirds up to?" I say, my eyes smiling. "We're getting lunch," Susan replies. "And can you stop trying to push that office romance? We're work colleagues, just that." "Of course," I say. "Apologies. I'll see you later Lance." I walk past him, patting his back as I do, and laugh to myself quietly. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Check out /r/Rhysyjay for other neat stuff.

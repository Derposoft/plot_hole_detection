Title: Found a New Spell Combination Text: Okay you guys, you're not going to believe this. So for those who haven't been following, when the Ebon Bell rang last week, I was one of the lucky ones that developed Spontaneous Extranormal Powers - or as we prefer, Sorcerers. I'm on YouTube as FireBallMaster if you want videos to prove I've got SEP. Although I'll admit, the name is a bit misleading, because my fireballs are actually kind of crap - check out Flame Princess if you want to see a real Pyromancer in action. But that's okay, because I've found something that will blow your minds. For those of you who have SEP, or the few that are starting to learn Trained Extranormal Powers, you know how this works. For the newbs though, here are the basics: Magic is performed by tapping into the Ley Lines that echoed out from the Ebon Bell. Sorcerers are people who have a built in connection to Ley Lines. Trained Extranormal Powered individuals, who I'm sure we'll start calling Wizards once there's more than a handful of them, have to manually tap in. With a Ley Line, you draw a Sigil in the air with your finger. (You can inbue wands or staves or other slender objects to store sigils, but that's another thread - check out this video by NeoSolomonsKey for about how to do that.) Or at least, you used to. What I've managed to do, through some pretty intense meditation I detail in this video, is create what I call a "Servitor," after the old Chaos Magic term. A Servitor is basically a mental construct that holds a sigil and, when activated, casts the spell. Without needing to move your hand. Now, the process is hard to replicate, but here's why everyone needs to watch this video and start learning it right now - so far, the only thing Governments have been able to do to control Sorcerors and Wizards is restrain them. Once we can move our hands, we can make Sigils, and once we can...well, we all saw what happened with The Laughing Cutter in Rykers by now. Sucks that a monster like him got SEP. But - with reports of governments hunting down Sorcerers due to potential chaos - I'm sure it'll never happen here in the States, but why risk it? - having a Servitor with some basic escape sigils programmed in is going to be pretty much essential. Hands free magic means they can't keep you locked up, right? The video details how to make a Servitor with a very basic spell - one that will coat your body with Alkahest, the universal solvent. Don't worry, you'll have a protection against your own Alkahest, but once you cast it...well, downside is, you'll be naked. Upside is, any restraints they put on you will be a slurry at your feet. Learn to call some Shadow Cloth once you've finished activating the Servitor, and you'll be free. Good luck out there. The New Age begins now, and we *will* be ascendant. -u/ FireBallMaster --- [Part 2 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/cc2gvb/street_magic_part_2/?) | [Part 3 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrael_Writes/comments/cc35vt/street_magic_part_3/?) more of my writing at r/hydrael_writes more of longer works by me and others at r/redditserials

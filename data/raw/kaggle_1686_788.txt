My forehead feels slick, as if I've woken up and just broken a fever. It is dark in my room, one of those hours when the night seems endless. I rub my eyes, and then I see it. GET TO SAFETY IMMEDIATELY. I sit up, and close my eyes, listening. What is happening? But there is nothing. No loud noises, no heat, no smell. Not like the night my wife... I get up, and start to move through the house. *The roller coaster just looks like a death trap, the paint rusted and chipped, the metal groaning with every roar of the car around its circuit. My stomach sinks just looking at the drop, almost vertical.* *RIDE WITH AMY.* *"Daddy, come on! It will be so fun." Her smile is pure, and if all that's all I had to see, I would do it, but I can't ignore the hulking ride behind her.* *"No," I say. "Daddy hates roller coasters."* *"Then let me go alone!""No. It's too dangerous."* *"That's not fair!"* *I close my eyes, and reopen them, hoping the directive is gone. It's still there.* The directive starts to blink, the way it does when you are disobeying. Amy's door is closed. It wasn't when I put her to sleep. I left the light in the hallway on, the way I normally do, so she can look at it if she gets scared. But now the light is off, and her door is closed. *The ride has stopped, right at the top. It stops with a big jolt, like it has hit something, and everyone's bones rattle as they are thrown forward.* *WAIT.* *"Daddy? What happened?"* *"Something's...wrong." I look down, and I immediately look back up. The car has detached slightly from the track on the right side.* *"Are we going to be okay?" All around us, parents and kids are panicking, and this only serves to make things worse. I close my eyes, praying for strength to come to me.* *"Listen to me. If anything happens, take my hand. If we fall, I will break your fall. Do you know what that means?"* *"W-what does it mean?"* *"It means you'll be okay, as long as I'm here. And I'll always be here, okay?"* *"Okay."* I push open the door. Three figures in helmets stand there. One of them holds a gun to Amy's head, and holds her forward, so I can look into my little girl's eyes. The figures are tall, and their helmets are...oblong, maybe too long to be for a human head. "We don't want to hurt her," one of them says, the voice sounding surround sound. "We just want you." "W-what?" "We want what you have. God's eye." "What are you talking about?" "We know what you have. It is very precious to us." I reach into my back pocket, looking right in Amy's eyes as the directive starts to flash insistently. *We are driving home, and Amy is dozing off next to me. I want to sleep too, and have to keep slapping myself to stay awake.* *"Daddy?" her voice, small and drowsy, says.* *"Yes, baby?"* *"Today, on the rolly coaster, I was so scared."* *"You were?" I almost tell her how scared I was too, but then I stop myself.* *"And then I wasn't scared. Thanks for making me feel safe."* *"Always."* *"I know, daddy. And mommy does too."* *And then she is sleeping again, and I am thankful, for this way she can't see the tears in my eyes.* LEAVE NOW. "Daddy?" she asks. "What's going on?" "Everything's going to be okay." "Okay," she says, and that's all the strength I need. I pull the knife out of my pocket, and put it up to my eyes. "You shoot, and I'll stab my right eye. God's eye." "You don't want to do this." "I'm going to walk out to walk out of here, and you better not do anything to her. If you do, you can say goodbye to your plans." "One last chance." I don't hear them. I look into Amy's eyes. "I'm going to come back for you, baby. Do you believe me?" Tears spill out of her eyes. "Of course, Daddy." And it breaks my heart to know that she doesn't fully. How can she? "When will I be there for you, Amy?" "Always," she squeaks. "I love you," I say, as I back out of the room, taking one last look at my daughter, hoping it won't be the last I see... - Inspired by the start of The Last of Us.

*Same old shift. Same old jokes.* Frank looked out over the bar, his eyes focusing on nothing in particular, barely registering the buzz of chatter between patrons. His hand twisted rhythmically, aimlessly rubbing a towel over the rim of a glass that had been dry for ten minutes. The sound of the small brass bell above the doorway snapped Frank out of his trance. He glanced up, hoping - just for a split second - for someone new. *Oh*, thought Frank, *the horse. Of course. Of course.* "Evening, Frank. I'll take a pint," the horse announced, finishing his sentence with an over-exaggerated sigh. Frank only nodded, saying nothing in response. In an almost zen-like state he pulled the horse's drink, refusing to engage, eyes fixed on the rising head that pooled over the amber liquid. Without a word, he slid the pint over to the horse, his lips screwed tightly together, his hands pressed so firmly against the bar his knuckles were turning white. The horse looked at Frank expectantly. A single bead of cold sweat trickled down his face and dripped quietly into his beer. He cleared his throat purposefully, but Frank refused to take the bait. Furtive whispers began to swirl around the bar. *Frank's not saying it! How can he not say it?* "Frank?" hissed the horse, shifting uncomfortably in his velour-capped barstool. "Don't you, um, have anything to - you know, to say?" All eyes were on Frank. The room became enveloped by an expectant, judgemental silence. "No." Under his breath, Frank uttered a single word. The patrons gasped audibly, and the horse's face cracked into an expression of pure disbelief, his mouth falling agape. Frank was visibly trembling, his heart racing as years and years of bad punchlines echoed in his head. *Put it on my bill! Should I have said DiMaggio? For you, no charge!* It was too much. The frustrations were finally bubbling to the surface. **"I won't say it!"** he bellowed. **"I won't! I can't indulge you people anymore! Night after night, I just want to run a business, but you're making a - a - a joke out of my bar! Out of me! Oh look, the priest, the rabbi and the minister - yeah, sure, I can count on three holy men to keep this place afloat, right? Nobody drinks like holy men! Why do you even come here?"** "But the blood of Christ -" interjected the priest before he was shushed a baseball-loving dog. **"And you!"** Frank now pointed accusingly at the gorilla, who was sheepishly frozen mid-sip, a Manhattan raised to his lips. **"No, we don't get many gorillas in here - why would we? - but tell you what, if you don't like my prices, you can leave! Good luck finding another bar that serves your kind!"** "That's a little racist," the rabbi muttered to the minister, who nodded sagely in agreement. **"And the blonde! The blonde! Is it legal for me to serve a woman with such a low IQ? Please, tell me - just for my own peace of mind - tell me there's some medical reason why I shouldn't get so frustrated with you. Do the redhead and the brunette actually hang out with you out of choice? Or were they appointed to you?"** "She sounds awful!" cried out the blonde supportively. The redhead and the brunette covered their faces in sheer exasperation. **"And the twelve inch pianist - I don't care. I just don't care! You want a big dick? Speak. More. Clearly!"** "Oh," quacked the duck excitedly from his seat in the booth, "*Now* I get it!" At this point Frank could barely form words and, in the absence of insults, his anger turned to sadness, and his eyes began to sting with tears. Overwhelmed by emotion, he collapsed on the bar and sobbed loudly and awkwardly, a man broken by one too many puns. The patrons grimaced collectively, each waiting nervously for someone, *anyone*, to do something to cut through the tension. The brunette gestured to the horse, who was still sat only a foot away from Frank, having experienced the whole rant at point blank range. Wincing, the horse leaned over the bar, clumsily patting Frank's shoulder with a hoof. "Frank," said the horse, trying his best to sound soothing, "Why the long face?"

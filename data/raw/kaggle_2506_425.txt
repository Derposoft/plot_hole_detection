Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this account, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time *is* at hand. Behold, he cometh with clouds, tinged crimson with the blood of humanity's bloated corpses. Every eye shall see him, both living and dead, and they also which pierced him shall see their forms arise, only to be cast down in flames. All kindred of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. I, John, who am also your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the state that is called Indiana, for the word of God, and for the deliverance from the Lord, given to us through the strength and justice of Jesus Christ. The Lord hath plummeted to the earth, and his fist hath plungeth into the soil; from his fist, flames hath purged the breath from the unliving. **I** **am** **Alpha** **and** **Omega,** **the** **beginning** **and** **the** **ending,** saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. From the four winds, I heard the Lord's voice, as of a trumpet, saying, **I** **am** **the** **Alpha** **and** **Omega,** **the** **first** **and** **the** **last,** and, **What** **thou** **seest,** **write** **in** **a** **letter,** **and** **send** **it** **unto** **the** **seven** **sanctuaries** **of** **humanity,** **which** **are** **in** **America;** **unto** **New** **York,** **unto** **Washington** **D.C,** **unto** **Chicago,** **unto** **Los** **Angeles,** **unto** **Houston,** **unto** **Dallas,** **and** **unto** **Boston.** The Lord rose. His countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength, and his voice was the sound of many waters, of power incarnate. When I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, **Fear** **not;** **I** **am** **the** **first** **and** **the** **last;** **I** **am** **he** **that** **liveth,** **and** **was** **dead;** **and,** **behold,** **I** **am** **alive** **for** **evermore,** **Amen;** **and** **have** **the** **keys** **of** **hell** **and** **death.** **Write** **the** **things** **which** **thou** **hast** **seen,** **and** **the** **things** **that** **thou** **shall** **seest,** **and** **deliver** **them** **unto** **the** **remnants** **of** **humanity,** **encouraging** **resistance** **and** **fortitude.** **Join** **me,** **John,** **as** **an** **apostle.** **You** **shall** **be** **the** **Scribe,** **the** **record** **of** **my** **strength.** **We** **shall** **bringeth** **the** **divine** **sword** **of** **justice** **unto** **our** **enemies.** The Lord bade me rise. **Grab** **thy** **chainsaw** **of** **truth,** **thy** **flamethrower** **of** **purity,** **and** **thy** **.460** **S&W** **Magnum** **of** **deliverance.** **Fear** **not,** **and** **follow** **me.** **Let** **us** **eviscerate** **some** **motherfucking** **zombies.** _____________________________________________________ Thanks for reading!

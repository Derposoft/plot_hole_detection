When i tell people i'm half orc, they tend to assume that one parent was an orc, and the other was something else. It's understandable--half anythings tend to get absorbed back into whichever parent's race is more convenient, or else die unmated and childless. But now and then a pair of crossbreeds get together, and the children of a half-orc and a half-orc will be half-orcs, right? If the details matter, i have no problem admitting that my mother was half orc, half human. Regarding my father, i'll say half orc and then hem and haw until the person i'm speaking to guesses half demon, at which point i'll nod reluctantly. &#x200B; ***** &#x200B; There's good money in hunting cultists. Some of the omnicidal deities scare the dung out of pretty much everybody, so we can get paid half-a-dozen times for the same job; and most of the cultists are just wannabes who couldn't summon an imp that was already in the room. Every once in a while, though, we hit the real thing and earn our pay from all those easy jobs ten times over. &#x200B; This was shaping up to be one of the real ones. There was a dank dark cave opening in a place where the local geology should have made a cave impossible. (When your dwarf says, "Can't dig here," you better believe there shouldn't be any underground spaces there, natural or artificial.) Our trips and traps expert went in, and came right back out reporting that none of her see-in-the-dark tricks were working right. &#x200B; "Demons," says our paladin. "And a pact already in place if they're messing with their surroundings like this. Better check our wards." &#x200B; "Demons aint the only creatures that do unnatural darkness," i say. "Better set **all** the wards." &#x200B; Me and my battle buddies (we never use names on a job; first thing an imposter or bodyjacker will do is try to call everybody by name) head in and sure enough, it aint just darkness. Demons can do dark, but they can't make the walls go all squirmy like that. "Stay behind me," i say. &#x200B; "Are you sure you can't expand that ward to include the rest of us?" our mage asks. &#x200B; "It would take a soul-bond," i say. "Meaning that if one of us gave in, we'd all go down with him." &#x200B; We all shut up, then, and keep going. Takes forever and no time at all (no i'm not talking about what it felt like; ask a mage or paladin or priest if you don't understand how it works) to get to the ceremonial chamber. Things brighten up again when we arrive, but it's bloodlight, not hellfire. Even our brawlers know what that means. &#x200B; The cultists are busy with an obvious summoning ritual. Chanting words in languages that make your brain hurt, scrawling runes in their own blood, the whole nine yards. Our *were* was calling dibs on her targets when our paladin says, "Too late, door's already half open." &#x200B; The rest of my crew is looking at each other nervously, cause everybody knows you have to close these kinds of portals from the other side. A hell-gate would be no big deal for a paladin--no worse than dying on this side of it, anyway; but this is something else entirely. &#x200B; "There's another way," i say. And before anyone can react, i step forward, prick my finger, and draw in the last rune. &#x200B; The portal finishes opening, and the nearest cultists get sucked in. Despite the fact that i'm standing even closer, i'm unaffected. After a few slurping sounds, an eye made of otherness appears. "Hi, Grandpa," i say. "These idiots are all yours, but please don't nibble on my friends, okay?" &#x200B; My battle buddies start whimpering when Grandpa speaks, but to me he sounds perfectly normal. "Sure thing. You ever going to come over for a visit?" &#x200B; I shake my head. "Nothing wrong with being an obligate sanivore, but i prefer to keep my options open. It's a lot easier to find good company when 'people aren't food'." &#x200B; "Suppose so," Grandpa says, and starts pulling in more cultists. I chuck the last one through the portal for him, he closes it, and i check to make sure he sealed it properly. &#x200B; I turn around to find my comrades all readying their weapons. "We need to get outside before this little pocket reality collapses," i say. They aren't buying it, even though they should know it's completely true. "Look," i try again, "there's tribes of orcs yet that like nothing better than roast human, but nobody cares that i'm half orc." They still aren't buying it. "Unless you got to pick your parents," i roar, "don't blame my father for not getting to pick his!" &#x200B; They back down enough to let us all get out of the cultists' little pocket dimension before it collapses, but they still aren't happy with me. "You defend that **thing**, but you won't tolerate even a hint of necromancy?" our mage complains. &#x200B; "Those things will take your wits," i answer, "but they can't touch your soul. Whatever they may siphon off, you get it all back or better once you reach your final home. Necromancers, though--they'll do their damnedest to pull you out of the one place that is supposed to be indisputably and irrevocably safe. &#x200B; "He's got a point," our paladin says. "But, couldn't you have told us?" &#x200B; I shrug. "Would you risk admitting to being descended from that which gods and demons fear?"

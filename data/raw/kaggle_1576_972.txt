*The reaper is back, the reaper is back* *He'll chop and he'll hack, he'll chop and he'll hack* *The reaper brings death, the reaper brings death* *He'll steal back your breath, he'll steal back your breath* *The reaper has rode, the reaper has rode* *To take what is owed, to take what is owed*. &#x200B; It was a nursery rhyme. I could hear the children singing it. Over and over and over and over in the rigid confines of my skull, rattling around like a faint echo but always there. Always noticeable. The doctors didn't believe me. They said I had PTSD from the incident. But they were wrong. I knew they were wrong. &#x200B; *The reaper is back, the reaper is back* *He'll chop and he'll hack, he'll chop and he'll hack* *The reaper brings death, the reaper brings death* *He'll steal back your breath, he'll steal back your breath* *The reaper has rode, the reaper has rode* *To take what is owed, to take what is owed*. &#x200B; Eventually they told me I was all right and that I could leave the hospital. But I wasn't all right. The tune was still hauntingly ringing inside, ringing inside, all the time, all the time. There was no way to make it stop. There was no way to make it stop. &#x200B; *The reaper is back, the reaper is back* *He'll chop and he'll hack, he'll chop and he'll hack* *The reaper brings death, the reaper brings death* *He'll steal back your breath, he'll steal back your breath* *The reaper has rode, the reaper has rode* *To take what is owed, to take what is owed*. &#x200B; If I was discharged, then I could return to life as normal, they told me. I could go back to work. But they were wrong, just as they were wrong about the song. Those children and their soft, innocent voices colliding against the bones in my noggin made sure I would never work again. I would never work again. &#x200B; *The reaper is back, the reaper is back* *He'll chop and he'll hack, he'll chop and he'll hack* *The reaper brings death, the reaper brings death* *He'll steal back your breath, he'll steal back your breath* *The reaper has rode, the reaper has rode* *To take what is owed, to take what is owed*. &#x200B; I tried everything. I sang it out loud. I listened to loud music. I saw more doctors. I took painkillers and I took stimulants. I drank and I drank and I drank. Here I am drinking again. Here I am drinking again. &#x200B; *The reaper is back, the reaper is back* *He'll chop and he'll hack, he'll chop and he'll hack* *The reaper brings death, the reaper brings death* *He'll steal back your breath, he'll steal back your breath* *The reaper has rode, the reaper has rode* *To take what is owed, to take what is owed*. &#x200B; Their honeyed vocalizations pound insistently against my forehead, now my eyes, now my nose, now my eyes, now my ears, now my eyes. I down drink after drink. I am very drunk but still the voices continue. Still the voices continue. Nothing will stop them. Nothing will stop them. "WHEN WILL IT END?" I scream, clenching a stein. Glass crunches under my palm and blood oozes. But all the pain is elsewhere, inside. "WHEN WILL IT END?" The bartender rushes over, extracts the shards from my bleeding hand. &#x200B; "What the hell is wrong with you?" He yells. He's calling a number in his phone. &#x200B; *The reaper is back, the reaper is back* &#x200B; "Stop," I say, as he lifts the receiver to his ear. He needs to stop. He needs to stop. Blood is pouring. Children are singing. He needs to stop. &#x200B; *He'll chop and he'll hack, he'll chop and he'll hack* &#x200B; The bartender is still on the phone. The bartender is still on the phone. "STOP!" I yell, and throw a stein with my bleeding hand at him. Glass tinkles, but not loud enough to drown out the voices. The man is lying on the ground, the phone is on the ground, the glass is on the ground. &#x200B; *The reaper brings death, the reaper brings death* &#x200B; Sirens wail in the distance. Sirens wail in the distance. The children are singing. The children are singing. Everyone else in the once-crowded bar has backed away. I am alone with shards, a lying man, and a bleeding hand. &#x200B; *He'll steal back your breath, he'll steal back your breath* &#x200B; Sirens get louder. Sirens get LOUDER. I am alone with shards, a lying man, and a bleeding hand. Maybe I cheated death. Maybe the reaper is coming for me. Maybe. Maybe. &#x200B; *The reaper has rode, the reaper has rode* &#x200B; I bring a long reflecting remnant up to my eye and look closely. A drop of blood, either mine or the bartender's, slides off the edge. Maybe I need to help the reaper. Maybe. Maybe. Sirens are louder. Sirens are here. &#x200B; *To take what is owed, to take what is owed*. &#x200B; I plunge the shard into myself again and again and again and again and again. Sirens are fading. The children are fading. The bartender is fading. The bar is fading. The song is fading. &#x200B; All that is left is a tall, silent hooded man greedily extending a hand toward my wrist. And then he starts. He starts singing. &#x200B; *The reaper is back, the reaper is back* *He'll chop and he'll hack, he'll chop and he'll hack* *The reaper brings death, the reaper brings death* *He'll steal back your breath, he'll steal back your breath* *The reaper has rode, the reaper has rode* *To take what is owed, to take what is owed*.

I stared numbly at the broken snoo, it's little antenna all askew and sad. I clicked the refresh button. Still broken. Frowning, I glanced at my wifi connectivity. It said I was connected, but you never could fucking believe Comcast and all of their lies. I mean, Google was still loading, but Google always seemed to load, whether I was actually on the internet or not. I just assumed they'd figured out some new beaming tech from their balloon wifi or whatever. Discretion being the better part of valor, I disconnected my wifi and reconnected it. After waiting the agonizing thirty seconds for things to cycle, I hit the refresh button again. Broken snoo. Reddit is down. Muttering to myself, I loaded up Twitter and checked their maintenance handle. Service interruptions. No ETA. These people had one job to do. How can you be the front page of the internet if you aren't on the internet? I didn't make any sense. I mean, I had a routine established and they were messing with my universe. Go to work, eat a hot pocket and then surf Reddit for three to four hours before crying myself to sleep in bed. I could trim it down to maybe an hour MAYBE. Perhaps just hit up r/relationships so I could at least feel better about the toxic wasteland my life was for a few minutes. And maybe just a QUICK tour of r/gonewild so I could help reinforce positive body image -- I'm a philanthropist like that. But total cold turkey? No Reddit at all? The shit was unimaginable. I hit the refresh button a few more times for good measure. No dice. I tapped back over to Twitter, *@Reddit Fix ur sh!t. I hope ur engineers die in a fire.* I always found constructive criticism delivered anonymously on the internet was the best way of encouraging positive reforms in people. Just one man doing my part 140 characters at a time. Or 280 characters. Whatever the hell Twitter was experimenting with these days. Those guys had even less of a clue then those asshats at Reddit that couldn't keep their shitshow showing. Refresh. Sigh. Refresh. No response on Twitter, though someone gave it a little heart thing. I felt little warm and fuzzies. Internet points had a way of validating my existence that I just couldn't get from my day-to-day. Slinging burgers at McDonalds isn't a very life affirming experience. Even the employee of the week award had lost some of its glow after I realized I was the only one who bothered to stay employed for more than week. Refresh. I began to hum a little tune, a few staccato notes to the tune of YMCA. "F! M! F! L!" I chanted out. "Yeah...Fuck My Fucking Life!" Refresh. Jesus. What are these guys doing? I glanced at the clock. A full three minutes had passed and the clowns still had their thumbs jammed up in their asses. It was almost enough to make me want to go back to school and get the CS degree I'd been meaning to get, just so I could rescue them from their own ineptitude. Refresh. At this point, it looked like I wasn't going to be rescued from my doldrums. I was going to be forced to face the facts: Reddit was never coming back. It had a good run, but all dumpster fires eventually choke themselves out. They burn brightly but briefly. This one's time had finally come. I whistled YMCA to myself a bit as I considered the alternatives. A tiny voice, deep within my soul, suggested that perhaps I could use this time for self-improvement and introspection. Maybe, just maybe, this was the wakeup call I needed to get my life out of neutral and start making some progress. A few evening classes. Hit the gym. A chance for a new me, one that ventured out and became more than what I was. Yes, perhaps today was the day. There's no time like the present. Carpe that fucking diem! Nodding to myself with determination, I began to type in the community college web site. I tried to remember the name...what was it? Oh yeah, New Horizons. I typed in N. I typed in E. It autocompleted to [netflix.com](https://netflix.com). Well, maybe just one show... **Platypus out.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

25M Finally Got Together With My Crush by t2_mipw84w9

So there is this asian girl 
Who works as an waitress at my regular diner
She's really HOT 
but she is also the best person on the planet her voice,manners, the way she talks she's just so sweet and loving and caring.

The first time i saw her she was taking my and my friend's order and i was just so mesmerized by how beautiful she was
I even went a lil nervous
My friend teased me about it 
I used to go there regularly we got along nice and were acquainted we talked often i would talk to her when she was free

And last week i asked her out 
She said yes and we went on a date some days later and she was dressed so elegantly for the ocassion
She was wearing this blue coloured tight and flowy bodycon dress 
and i just felt so infatuated by looking at her 

we spent the date talking, laughing, flirting, 
and it was more like dinner with friends instead of a date 
and i went to drop her off 
and i thought she wont be seeing me again so i went to her building and when i was at the gate i told her 
Thanks for going on a date with me and told her good night 
And just as i was talking she gave me a lil peck on my lips 
and asked me if i wanted to come up, 
i said sure and we went up to her apartment we sat in the living room she poured us some wine  
and we talked and she got close to me on the couch and she asked me what did i think of what she did downstairs
And i told her how i felt
And i pulled her close to me and kissed her and we started making out and she got on my lap
And she started unbuttoning my shirt 
and then she told me 
To lets go in her bedroom i picked her up 
and carried her off 
and we did it

Our chemistry was so good
We connected on every level 
I spent the night 
and in the morning she woke me up
She gave me a kiss when i woke up
And i asked so are we dating 
And she smiled and said yes 
She was wrapped in the sheets 
I stayed at her apartment for a while


(ok so that was the lovely and wholesome part
This is a little embarassing part)

After i got dressed and got out of her bedroom
I saw her roommates there
And i just got really nervous
And i said to her in a low voice
You have roommates?
She said yes and took me to the couch
And we were sitting there and i was just so nervous
They definetly noticed and they smiled at suffering a lil
I then took the leave and kissed her Bye

But i am really grateful that i got together with the women i love and i don't know how to describe it

"Who, who will hear us?" I stared blankly at the screen, with the message flashing, taunting me in its simplicity. I craned my neck around to my superior officer, who was leaning over me with the same stupefied look on his face. "I don't know, sir." I looked back to the screen and my hands gravitated back to the keyboard. "Do we really want to ask?" "This isn't real. It's a prank. Has to be." Captain Jefferies stood up straight and folded his arms. "A prank from outer space? This can't just be some kid..." "It could be some kid. Fucking kids attack sites all the time, with all that computer shit." I desperately fought back a sigh. "This is a state of the art receiver, pointed at the heavens. No one on earth other than us has the technology to put even a blip on this thing." The captain made a noise that sounded like he wasn't happy with my reassurances. "Ask them who they are." I shrugged, then pecked away at the keyboard. We both stared silently at the screen for several long moments. "See, I told you it was a-" CUT ALL COMMUNICATIONS NOW. YOUR COUNTERPARTS HAVE ALSO BEEN WARNED. IT IS NEAR. IT IS NEAR. We continued to stare silently at the screen, although this time it was in pure shock. [One Day Later] I sat back in my chair, staring at the screen. The receiver window was open, and I was scrolling through the results. In the previous twenty-four hours, every news outlet in the world had jumped on the alien bandwagon. We hadn't leaked it, but several of the other civilized nations that had decoded the message had. England had been the most surprising of those. The result was insane. I had been wrong about being the only ones able to receive and send messages. It wasn't the first time I'd been wrong, of course, and hopefully wouldn't be the last. Messages were pouring in over the receiver, all from our side of the equation. Who are you? *Who is coming?* *Come to our country first! We'll make a spot on the pitch for you to land at tonight's game!* *We love you! Peace and love!* *This better not be a threat!* I groaned, sifting through the ridiculous amount of messages scrolling across the feed. How in the hell did this get out so fast, and how were so many underfunded Earth denizens sending out signals? "The communications from Earth are lighting us up like a light bulb in the night sky," the captain said from behind me, making me jump. "Yeah," I said, shaking my head. "Yes, sir," I added. "You still think the original wasn't a hoax?" "I don't think it was sir, but I could be wrong. I certainly didn't see this coming," I said, gesturing at the screen. "I don't either, and neither does the President. He's going to ask for radio silence in his speech tonight." "Pardon my judgment, sir, but won't that be a little too late?" The captain paused, hovering by the double windows of the observation room. I heard him curse under his breath. "It already is, Specialist." "Come again?" "Look out that window." I stood up from my chair, looking at the commander first. His rugged face was pale white, though his features were as stern as ever. I strode over to the window. The sky was a little darker than it should be on an August afternoon. Noting my quizzical look, the captain spoke. "That's no cloud, boy." Cursing, I rushed back to the computer. A new, bolder message appeared. YOU WERE WARNED. No, fuck that, I thought. This isn't all our fault. I began typing. *Requesting aid. Please send a representative or defense strategy.* I waited, and the captain opened his mouth to say something, but clamped it shut just as quickly. He rested a hand on my shoulder and waited with me. THERE IS 97% CHANCE OF TOTAL SPECIES ANNIHILATION. *Please send full report on invaders.* PROCESSING. SENT. BEST OF LUCK HUMANS. I sighed, wondering how they sent a file and where. "We have about five minutes to find what they sent and how it can help." "I agree, Specialist." The captain squinted at the screen. "You better get on it."

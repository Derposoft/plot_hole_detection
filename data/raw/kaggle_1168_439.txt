Okay, well can you give me a little bit more info than just 'It doesn't work'? So, I haven't posted in this subreddit before, but when someone asks specifically about my job, I thought why the hell not. Here are some of the callers that make you wonder how they even got their spellbook open, seriously (well one didn't). **** **Richard from Texas** Me: "Thank you for calling Jazzy Spell IT how can I help you?" R: "Hi, I just bought one of these spell books, I'm reading the spell to my aunt but there's no reanimating going on." Me: "Alright, how long has the person been dead for?" R: "4 days now" Me: "Okay, can you bring me through the process of your spell?" R: "Alright, so I pour the ashes onto the table, and I read the spell out loud. Nothing" Me: "Umm sir, I think it's very clear in the manual the person has to be in one piece" **** **Zachary from Tennessee** Me: "Thank you for calling Jazzy Spell IT how can I help you?" Z: "Hi I am trying to reanimate a dog but nothing's happening" Me: "Alright, what part are you getting stuck on? Have you tried closing and reopening the spell book?" Z: "Yeah quite a few times, it's getting really frustrated." Me: "Are you sure that the dog isn't reanimated, but just hasn't been energized?" Z: "Yup, I'm on the phone with my mom now and she says she's tried energizing the dog but nothing's happening." Me: "Umm, ma'am, are you in the same room as the dog is?" Z: "No, oh, do I have to be?" **** **Phil from.. I couldn't even really understand where he was from** Me: "Thank you for calling Jazzy Spell IT how can I help you?" P: "Hi I got one of your spell books but I can't get the damn thing open." Me: "Okay, have you read the instruction manual on the back?" P: "Uh, that's another thing. I'm not quite sure how to read so I was hoping you could walk me through it." Me: "Sir, how do you plan on reading the spell out loud if you can't read?" **** **Samantha from New Jersey** Me: "Thank you for calling Jazzy Spell IT how can I help you?" S: "I told you, it just isn't working" Me: "What part of it isn't working? Have you tried closing and reopening the spell book?" S: "What spellbook?" Me: "What do you mean, do you have the spells memorized?" S: "What spells?" Me: "Do you know who you're calling?" S: "This is Microsoft technical support right?"

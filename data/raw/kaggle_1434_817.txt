"Let's see..." I said, looking at the list my girlfriend had given me. Really nice of her going through the whole shop, selecting everything she wanted, and then having me come here alone to get it all. It was going to take me forever to find the stuff, why didn't she just tag along to show me? "Ar..." "Arang..." Damn names! I'm sure those weren't even real Swedish words. Or was it Danish? I decided to act like I new how to pronounce them correctly... by basically mutilating the vowels of all the letters that had extras. You know, hyphens and stuff. Do you know what it's called if a letter has extra circles? If I was going to have to search for all this, I at least wanted to have some fun memorizing the names so I could find everything. "[ALVANGEN](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/29543/) [PATAR](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/36839/) [VIDGA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/38612/) [FARGRIK](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/15397/)." I said in my best fake Scandinavian accent as I went into a room with some nice couches that I would have liked to sit on while my girlfriend ran around deciding what to carry home. "[ALVANGEN](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/29543/) [PATAR](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/36839/) [VIDGA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/38612/) [FARGRIK](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/15397/)!" I said louder, looking at some woman who was passing through and shaking her head at my trying to strike a speaker's pose. "[ALVANGEN](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/29543/) [PATAR](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/36839/) [VIDGA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/38612/) [FARGRIK](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/15397/)!!!!" I shouted at no one, smiling at the thought that I wasn't going to be chastised and told to grow up. I did expect the possibility of some IKEA drone getting a bit miffed and telling me to turn down the volume, which I would gracefully do in Exchange for finding the stuff on my list. I did not expect a big poof of very stinky smoke appearing right in front of me on a Knubbeldubbel Erkderp or what ever that coffee table in front of me was named, revealing a 7-feet pro-wrestling sized and muscled red-winged red-skinned horned demon who was naked except for a towel he thankfully held together with one of his huge hands. "EEEK!" I screamed, somehow managing to muffle the scream to conversation noise levels as my brain went into overdrive and decided that not being noisy was in my survival's interest and that turning around and running as fast as I could would be a good idea. Also, it continued my evaluation of possible IKEA terminology and wondered what kind of item an EEEK would be as I did turn around, hit my shin on a thankfully well-cushioned sofa on my first step, fell over it an landed on the other side on my back. Maybe some kind of pot? I was only half hidden behind that sofa as I had fallen over it at a diagonal angle. So I had a very good view of the demon's buttocks as he raised both hands in triumph, along with the towel in one hand and some bottle of shower gel in the other. "YES!" he shouted, starting a little dance that the coffee table didn't seem to appreciate. "IT WORKED!" I tried to very quietly crawl away as the demon carefully stepped down from the else-to-be-ex-table. The demon looked around, saw me, and approached me, at the same time attacking my manliness and ruining my hope that all heavily muscled guys were just compensating for their small penises. I rolled onto my back and defensively raised my hands in front of me, because unfortunately my "Run away as fast as you can!" brain emergency seemed to have overloaded and switched to deer-in-headlight mode. "Oops, sorry!" the demon said to me. "You got me at an inopportune time. At least I wasn't on the shitter, ha!" he said and wiggled his fingers around and mumbled some arcane words. I assume they were arcane because he suddenly shrunk down to trucker size, along with getting some nice Italian outfit. At least I assumed it was Italian because it looked like a fine, expensive suit and if he could just summon that from thin air, why not choose an Italian one? "Thanks for summoning me!" he said to me as he extended his hand to help me up. "I've been waiting for weeks for someone to get the right combination." I decided to let him help me up. Being all buddy with a possibly still naked Demon seemed to be the better choice than screaming loudly and maybe getting dragged to hell. "You... uh... arranged for your summoning?" I asked, wondering exactly how a demon would do that. He nodded at me as the woman from before passed the room again, seeing me and just shaking her head again. "Why... why do you want to be summoned here?" I asked instead of KThxBying the hell out of there. "I need some [BILLY](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/28102/)s for the Missus, along with two [POANG](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/07472/)s." he said. "She's been pestering me for weeks now to get them after she got the last catalog." "Also, I like the meat balls!"

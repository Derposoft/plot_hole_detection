I took a moment to take in the sight--the gold which never rusted had been scratched off, the lock that only opened to those most deserving of heaven's grace lay broken on the ground. And the gates now opened for anyone and everyone. Things had changed since last I came. "Gabriel," I called into the clouds beyond the gate. Nobody answered back. "Michael? Raphael?" The same silence replied. I pressed my lips into a tight line and walked into Our Father's kingdom. --- The clouds lay empty. No souls tread upon them and no angels flew through them. Even the light of heaven had ceased to shine as brightly, glowing into the dim incandescence of an oil lamp. I peered through shadows that should not have existed and walked toward the throne of God. If anyone knew what had happened, it was the One who knew everything that had happened and ever would. I walked through shadows of empty buildings and tattered clouds. Their shadows seemed to grasp at my legs with icy bite. But I did not fear their touch. I refused to. Not in the Kingdom of Heaven. So I walked through their grasp until I arrived at the centermost cloud. Here, a church of solid gold stood erect. Its painted windows, where glass angels used to dance, now lay shattered into fanged edges. Its great oak doors were flung open and hanging from single hinges. A frigid breeze blew from within. I shivered. Not just because of the cold, but because of the shadow that covered God's throne. Shadows were not supposed to exist in heaven and now it obscured even the seat of the Lord. Perhaps, I had been gone for too long. "Father," I called out and stepped into the church as my voice echoed through its halls. The shadows crept around me, encroaching upon the walls, slithering through the floors and growing darker where my Father should've sat. "God is not here," a raspy voice croaked with a chuckle. "Only I." I squinted through the blackness, but could see nothing. "Who dares defile the throne of our Lord?" "*Your* Lord," the voice spat back. And suddenly, the shadows fled, revealing a dismembered figure at the foot of the throne. It was God. And he was dead. "Though your Lord no longer." My breath caught. My lips trembled as I pushed the words out, "father?" The shadows split apart revealing blood-stained wings spilling off of heaven's throne and a sickly smile that cut across the angel's face. "Welcome home, Jesus Christ," Lucifer said, smiling. "Did you have fun on Earth?" I grasped the air, curling my fingers into fists. "The Kingdom of God is not yours to take!" "The Kingdom of God belongs to whoever can take it," Lucifer said. "And I have just done so." "You are not the rightful Lord." Lucifer sighed and pushed himself up. "A wrongful lord is still a lord. A false god is still a god. And the son of a dead god means nothing to me." The floor opened up beneath my feet. I had time for a single breath before I fell through a red tunnel that would lead me straight to the depths of hell. Flames licked my robes and my beard. And as I fell, only a single thought played in my head--*If the Kingdom of God belongs to whoever can take it, then I'd have to do just that*. --- --- /r/jraywang for 2+ stories a day, continuations by popular demand, and more!

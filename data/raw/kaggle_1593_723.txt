They will try anything to get to you. They are relentless, but they are weak, so as long as you stay inside, shut all the windows, and wait for your drops, you'll be fine. But nothing prepares you for when they are actually there, banging on the door. You have to remind yourself that they are not actually there, that their survival instinct is simply making use of their memories to compromise you emotionally and unlock a door, so that they can get to you and revert to the bloodthirsty predators they are. But it is so hard. "Daddy, please! I'm so hungry," my daughter wails. From looking through the keyhole, I know that she is slumped against the doorframe pathetically, her limbs askew. I have shot my son and my wife, but somehow, this is the hardest. My daughter was always so sweet, so independent and so thankful anytime anyone did anything for her. And now she is here, begging for the first time in her life. I think back to the day at the carnival, when she thought I was a superhero for somehow making the ball into the basket. I think of the day she scored her first basket in the last game of the season, and she ran over and hugged me while the game was still going on. I even think of the times she would scream at me in the later years, telling me I didn't understand, telling me I never had, and I would smile because she could never know how much I did. "I can't. You have to know that," I say, shaking. "It's so cold. It's so dark. I don't know what to do, Daddy. I just want to come inside and be with you. I'm so scared." I tell myself to stay strong, but my hands have gone slack on the shotgun. *She is not there*, I tell myself. "I'm so scared, Daddy. Why won't you help me? What did I do wrong?" she wails. "I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!" I close my eyes, trying to forget where I am. I have always been good at doing this, whenever things get to be too much, my boss breathing down my neck at the office, at the airport when everyone's just heard that the flight was delayed again, at home with my wife screaming at me for not caring enough. I have always been able to forget, because I never did care about most things enough. But now, I can't. "I'm sorry I always said no when you wanted to do something when I was older. I'm sorry I always came home late on weekends and lied to you. I'm sorry I said I didn't want you at my graduation." Her voice is thin, weak, scratchy. How can this not be real? "Please leave," I say, desperate, knowing it won't do anything. "Please. I love you so much. But I can't let you come inside." "Why!" she screams. "Why?""I can't. I just can't." Nothing. This catches me off guard. All night, she has been clawing and banging and screaming and weeping, and now she is silent. I hear a single sniffle. "Is everything going to be okay, Daddy?" she finally asks. "Are we going to be okay?" This is it, I realize. The moment when their instinct, their motor, finally runs out. The moment when they are most human, and thus most weak. I walk over to the door. My hand trembles on all the locks, and finally the doorknob. I open the door. For a second, I accept destiny, if she is going to jump on me, tear out a chunk of my neck. But that does not happen. She simply looks up, and her eyes are wide, blue, human. I see something in them, but I do not know what it is. Before I can think about it and maybe figure it out, I raise the shotgun. She keeps looking into my eyes as I steady it. I fire. Everything goes black and red. __________________________________________________________ Edit: Wow! Thanks so much for reading and for responding, positive or otherwise. Really made my ~~day~~ year.

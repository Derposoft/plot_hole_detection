"Yes, yes. Don't be shy! For I am a proprietor of wonders! I am a salesman of bliss made tangible!" Daddy Dodo stood on stage, his feathercap slightly obscuring his vision, but he didn't care. It looked too cool not to pass up. In one hand, he held a diamond-studded cane, the other a golden stage pistol that he had named Ollie. The theater was filled with people, yet no one but him spoke a word. His guards were at the corners. You had a Coffee Card, and access to the Midnight Stage was yours. You didn't? All that was behind those ebony doors was a theater that hadn't played a movie since 1933. He truly was a proprietor of wonders. Stage magician by day, coffee smuggler by night. He bounced around town on a half-broken Segway, but really he was starting to roll in the dough. People needed coffee, and Dodo knew it. Dodo was real smart like that. Productivity had dropped, especially since 2025's Caffeine Ban had gone into effect. But Daddy Dodo didn't need to worry. He had friends in Colombia who would do things for him, as long as he did certain things in return. So, in that friendly vein, Dodo became one of the most prolific coffee smugglers of 2027. As Daddy Dodo danced back and forth on stage, he tossed a bag of coffee beans back and forth in his hands. He brought it near his face, stuck his tongue out. "Yes, yes, I must agree! The bravest of whom shall get this rare, deluxe, specially crafted culture of coffee beans. The rest of y'all will be going home with a smaller bag of standard Colombian coffee beans!" Applause broke out in the audience. There were doctors, lawyers, teachers, radio hosts, news folks. All turned a blind eye to Daddy's illegal doings down in the dumps of the devilishly decrepit dream palace. People needed the beans, man. People really needed them, for the sake of the economy. Daddy Dodo considered himself a hero, not a villain. The hero of the caffeine-starved, the hero of the tired and weary. Just show your Coffee Card, and consider yourself saved. "Ok, ok, now. I'm going to choose the lucky number seat out of the roster. Okay, ya'll, it's gonna happen." The attendant, dressed in a brown dress with a freshly styled bowtie in her hair, brought out a glossy black top hat in her hands. She put a hand in the hat, and Daddy winked at her. *She felt disgusted.* "And....Daddy's number is....," she continued to move her hands inside, fishing through the hundred labels, and eventually pulled one out. "Seventeen! Where's lucky seat seventeen!" A mousy woman with graying hair put her hands to her mouth, as the cheering people around her encouraged her to go up there. She teetered down the aisle, stepping up the stage, where she felt like a periwinkle in the spotlight. Dodo extended his hand out to her, she took it nervously, and smiled. "Ah, now that the audience has stopped clapping. Mademoiselle, what is your name?" he asked softly, yet clearly. She balked, before responding. "I'm Jenna, and I'm a receptionist!" Daddy Dodo chuckled. "But I didn't even ask you what you did yet. You're a psychic, my dear madam?" She smiled timidly, and Dodo clapped his hands together. The attendant hurried of stage, and came back having dragged a large box with a question mark plastered to the sides. Obviously heavy, as the attendant struggled slightly to move it into place. When it was *just* right, Dodo dismissed the attendant with a wave of his hand. "Okay, now, I'm going to consult Ollie." he remarked, putting the diamond-studded staff at his side straight to his ear like a telephone. There were some interjected chuckles and guffaws around. "Okay, Ollie says...you gotta shoot into that box!" "Sh-shoot?" Jenna asked. "Is it safe? This is my first time with a Coffee Card..." "Safe? Of course! It's one-hundred percent safe, emphasis on the hundred. See?" he waltzed over, and pressed the question mark on the side, which opened the box up for everyone to see. "Nothing, nada, not a thing. The trick is in what'll happen." "Um....ok." Jenna mumbled. She let her hands be guided by Dodo, as he handed the stage pistol to her. *3,2,1, shooooot! Bang, bang, bang!* Jenna shot into the box, one, two, three times, which opened up in every direction to reveal a cockatoo, which hobbled to the other side of the stage with little concern or injury. There was an enthusiastic applause, and Jenna handed the pistol back to Daddy, a wide-eyed look on her face. "Thanks for playing, Jenna, you've been real brave and real helpful. Here's your prize!" Dodo announced, thrusting the bag of coffee beans in her hands. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Later that night, after a few more tricks, everyone left home with the coffee beans they'd been craving. Daddy Dodo and the attendant stood on stage, in front of an invisible audience. "Hey, roll that box on stage." Dodo muttered. When he received no answer, he repeated his order. "Do it now, bitch." She, without protest, wheeled the box back on stage. "Good, now I don't have to hit you with Ollie. Again." He pressed the button, and the box opened to reveal a bullet-ridden man, blood staining the bottom. "Just another Colombian snitch, where he belongs." ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- r/bluelizardK

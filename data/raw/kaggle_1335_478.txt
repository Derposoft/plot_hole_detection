"Roy, what in god's name are you up this late for?" "Leave me alone 'Mother' I need to grind out more constitution if I want to make it on the basketball team this year." It was 1:00 am. I had crafted my own lunch and dinner to optimally improve my CON gains. Not only that, I had went out and gotten an energy drink and a sports drink. The drinks put a +4 on my sugar intake bar which if maxxed out triggered the 'Obesity' debuff. However, it reduced my fatigue gains meaning I had longer to grind out more CON. *Dudu-du-du duduruuuu~* With that jingle, I knew I had reached the next tier of CON. I could meet the stat check tomorrow. With that, I was on track to completing 'The Rose-colored High School Life' Questline. --part two-- "Oh my god. Oh my god. My heart is racing at like a bajillion bpm..." "Calm down, Wesley. You're going to be fine." "How can you be sure, Roy? I'm not like you! I'm not some fount spewing confidence like I had the equation to life, okay?" "I mean, when have I been wrong?" "AP History. Last Semester. The Second Test!" Oh yeah... he rolled three Ones during the exam. I've literally never seen anyone roll so horribly in my life before. "Wesley. That was **one** test. Trust me. You've got this." I hadn't worked on my Parley in awhile, so my smile came off as haughty. But, it did the job with a commendable *14*. "Whew. Okay, you're right. Stats don't lie." Wesley had the 'Nervous' trait. It meant that he would roll badly in high pressure moments, but it made him also over-prepare. --part three-- *Math Test Cleared!* As I walked out of the classroom with Wesley, I could hear my score tick up and up. *DingDingDing-ding... ding... ding. Bang!* **New High Score!** Nice! I had beaten my previous test scores meaning I got at least a 95. "I... I think I aced it." "See, what did I tell ya." Wesley rolled better than he usually did too. Meaning, he did just as good if not better than me. Up next: PE. We walked down the hall and took a left to exit the building. It was blindingly bright outside almost summer break. I squinted and kept walking when- Bam! *Random Encounter!* I had accidentally bumped into somebody. "Sorry... I didn't watch where I was going..." "Watch it!" Judging from the letter jacket and voice, it was Abdul. With baseline DEXterity and CON as high as his, it was no wonder he was on varsity football. But with literally zero diplomacy, I couldn't help but be a bit pissed off. *Nyeerooo nyeerooo nyeeroo* Shit! My reputation bar just took a hit. I was going to have to increase my Parley, otherwise I'm going to trigger 'Nasty Rumors.'

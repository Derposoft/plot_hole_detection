Grand Ambassador N'Arvajz was tired. The endless audiences with leaders of newly discovered sentient species that the High Council authorised were, without exception, dull and predictable. His vessel landed, the natives observed him in awe as he descended in a grand display and the leadership of the planet rushed to pay tribute and establish a favourable relationship with the Vulnax. This exact sequence played out in his mind as he descended on yet another newly recognised planet, XS+ 1329l, local designation(s): Terra, Earth, Gea, Zemlia, Di Qiu , Erde, etc. He has seen other planets be called by multiple names, but the abundance of names for this insignificant speck annoyed him to no end. "Go on ahead for me Lieutenant, let's mix it up and show them the military aspect first for a change." Lieutenant Baltrhikh nodded and, as the ramp was slowly lowered, attached several ornaments to his parade armour. The ramp had fully lowered and as the Grand Ambassador lazily went over the translated messages exchanged between his navigational crew and the planet one last time, Baltrhikh began his pompous walk down the ramp's incline. **BANG** "Fireworks, great, I didn't think it possible for these people to be that primitive but so be it" N'Arvajz thought to himself as his personal terminal finished translating the final few audio recordings of the human messages. The next to last message played, in clear, unmistakable Vulnaxxi. **BANG** "State your purpose and remain in orbit until we agree on terms for your landing, state whether or not you are carrying any weapons and await escort from below." That was odd, but mot unheard of, some species were simply overly cautious, he didn't think much of it and played the final message. **BANG** **BANG** Maligning the savagery of such a barbaric welcome once again, he listened. "No more warnings shall be issued, we will give you the benefit of the doubt as your communications equipment might have malfunctioned but once you land, we will board your vessel. Anything other than opening a boarding path for our troops will be considered an act of aggresion." At this precise moment, the ship was rocked and another loud explosion could be heard. N'Arvajz rose from his terminal ans rushed to the door of his office. As he opened it, the sight in front of him was beyond description. Lieutenant Baltrhikh's body lay on the floor, dismembered, alongside most of the ships military personnel. Several humans were also laid out around the main exit, most were still moving, despite the Grand Ambassador clearly seeing all of them were injured with standard issue security blasters. They were large, imposing figures, likely more than twice the height of the average Vulnaxx. His photo-receptors followed the noise that he felt coming from his junior officers quarters to the right and there it was. A huge, no, a gigantic human rushed out of the door and spotted N'Arvajz. The human yelled something and another two appeared from adjacent compartments in the ship. "Looks like a civilian, cuff it." His translator implant relayed and only now did the entire gravity of the situation dawn on the envoy. He was being imprisoned, his ship was about to be seized and most of his crew were dead or dying. This diplomatic journey was nothing like any he'd experienced so far. *Excerpt from the prologue of* ***Humans, the scourge of Vulnax*** *written by junior diplomatic officer Jokh'Niz and Grand Ambassador N'Arvajz during their imprisonment on Earth.

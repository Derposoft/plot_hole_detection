It was a short drive to the Langley office. My last visit here had been a mere two weeks ago. As it happens on these monotonous drives, my mind started to take me over the events of the last few days, well, last two weeks in this case. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ It was only my third day in the Agency and I had been called into a meeting with the deputy director for internal affairs. Having been recruited straight out of university and then sent through an intensive 14 month training, I was ready to embark on my new role. &nbsp; While walking towards the IA offices section, I began to wonder what I might have done in the last 3 days that would warrant a personal meeting with the big man. But I did not need to wonder for long as I was introduced to 3 analysts, a senator, a judge and 2 women whose identity I was told, was none of my business. "Have you understood Mr. Wallace?", asked the deputy director. "You will head to the FBI field office in D.C and assume your role in their finance department. We just need to know how it happened?". "Yes Sir!", I answered and was then promptly given a dossier with my identity, a few other need to know details and was sent on my way. &nbsp; Apparently I was to use my actual credentials, given my graduate background in accounting and finance. The mission, if I can be cheesy enough to call it that was simple enough. Once in the correct department, basic files would give me the information I needed. "Good morning", I said to the handsome suited man behind the reception; "I am starting today with the finance department". A few forms, orientations, meetings and horrible ice breaker jokes later I was at my desk. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Day bloody three again and I am on a flight headed to Aberdeen to "Join MI6". I could not even being to write the kind of amazing stupidity that was my meeting this morning. I almost seems like a sick joke. If I did not know better, and truth be told I do not; this almost seems planned. "You will head to the MI6 office in Aberdeen and assume your role in their finance department. We just need to know how it happened?", he said. I almost choked on my coffee. "Everything you need is in the dossier", he said. Deja vu. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 3 days and thankfully I am still here at the office. The accent is not as pronounced as I was led to believe in training. Thankfully a lifetime of monosyllabic answers have allowed me to keep my cover. The timing was perfect. There was an internal audit planned and I was to be part of it. "A little on the job horror is always good", said my boss. I smiled as I packed away for the day. &nbsp; That night I barely slept a wink, preparing all night for how I was to go about getting the files I needed. I don't think that I will ever forget that feeling of heaviness as I was pulled aside walking into the conference room. "The gov. wants to have a word", said Williams as he motioned to the section heads door. &nbsp; "So as you see Mr. Davies, you will head to the CIA office in Langley and assume your role in their finance department. We just need to know how it happened?". I think he pitied me for the expression on my face as he added, "Cheer up son. You are young and new enough that they will not know who you are. This makes you the perfect man for the job." There was no conceivable response that I could come up with. Hell, I don't even remember any part of the training covering this. &nbsp; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I parked in the guest spot and walked straight into the deputy directors office. I said nothing as he started at my face with a confused expression when I handed over my 'Introduction' papers to him. What felt like hours of silence was broken by "eh?". "I have been sent to investigate Mr. Wallace regarding the disappearance of the funds", I replied as I sat down heavily in the chair, closing my eyes and pressing my head to mitigate the oncoming headache I was sure was the birth of my first aneurysm.

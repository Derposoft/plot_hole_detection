[PART 1/3] *As the Dark Lord of the Darklands, it is with great pleasure to congratulate you on being noticed by us. We only recognize the worst and the darkest for our menacing academy. Hence, we cordially invite Reynauld Stormhammer, son of Alfric Stormhammer and Relya Quickquiver, to Calamity University.* *If accepted, then a full scholarship will be extended to Reynauld Stormhammer alongside any additional funds needed to ensure the worse can become the worst.* *We commend you and yours on making the world a little bit darker than you left it.* *With worst regards.* *Insincerely ,* *Chancellor Maledictum* *Mayhem* Reynauld and his father stared at the dark black letter that had been sitting on their dining table for the past two weeks. The letter had come with both a course catalog and a terrifying painting of a red spire jutting out of cracked, blackened earth. It looked exactly like a prototypical castle for the cruel. Next to that letter and its contents was a much larger stack of papers. Each one of them had dark, red letters saying *rejected*. Alfric Stormhammer, one of the greatest paladins in Earetland's recent history looked at this son. "It's a full ride, Reynauld... I'm telling you it's worth it." Reynauld shot up and slammed his hands on the wooden table between them. "It's the academy of *evil,* dad! Evil! You know that thing that I swore that I would vanquish. I swore to Ishna on my tenth birthday to do so! Just like you did!" Alfric's face strained as he heard those words. "I *know* son... I was there when you made your vows. Same goddess as me and your mother, but think about it son. It's a *full* ride. I didn't get that during my academy years and *I'm* still paying off my debts. You could go through college, get your Blessing in whatever they do at that school and come out a paladin. I know Ishna would be fine with it. She's been telling me how she can't wait for you to get through an academy. Say's that... you're something..." Alfric's voice trailed off. Reynauld gave his father a suspicious look. Reynauld knew that he was possibly the *worst* paladin in training. Every blessing became a curse with him. Every call to light beckoned in darkness. Even something as simple as divine healing became a dreadful disease. So bad in fact that the Dark Lord congratulated him. Imagine being *so* bad at the good that evil thinks you're doing a good job. Reynauld crossed his arms and reluctantly looked at the other pile of letters on the desk. They were all rejection letters from actual schools he wanted to go to. Notre Gaine's school for the ascended? Rejected. Marvard's academy for the brightest? Rejected. Boxford's university for the chosen? Well, they hadn't rejected him... They just didn't even bother sending a letter back. Reynauld didn't have many choices. Calamity U. was still accredited as a tier-one school. It *would* technically count when Reynauld went for his Blessing of Ishna. He'd just have to figure out how to take the Dread Knight track and make it... well make it more like a Paladin track. His father had done some course theory crafting, the course catalog came with the invitation letter. Alfric had managed to cobble up a Paladin self-study path through the Dread Knight track. Honestly, the more Reynauld looked at it, the more tempted he was by the offer. Which made him blanch. He never thought that he would have to deal with Dark Lords and their tempting offers *this* early in his paladin career. "Your mother thinks it's a good idea too. After all, *it's* a *full* ride." Alfric's encouraging tone just made Reynauld feel more disheartened. Reynauld looked at his father with a raised eyebrow. "Here I thought that paladins weren't supposed to make deals with the dark?" Alfric coughed and cleared his throat. "Sorry, there's something in my throat." "Is it a white lie?" Alfric shot his son a level look. "You know son, sometimes you remind me a *little* too much of your mother." Reynauld returned his father's neutral look with a glare. His father sighed. "Okay, okay so you're right. Paladin's *aren't* supposed to deal with the dark. But Ishna and I talked about it..." Reynauld straightened up in surprise. "No way, even *she* is saying it's a good idea?" Alfric nodded at that. Reynauld looked up at the ceiling and groaned. "Even you too?" A beam of light came shooting through the window and onto the wooden table. Reynauld looked at it and saw something impossible in the light. A single golden word etched itself into the table. *Yes.* Reynauld threw his hands up and yelled, "okay fine! Fine, I'll go!"

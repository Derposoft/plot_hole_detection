The camp isn't far from here. I lean against the rotting tree for a second, trying to get my bearings. Just around that tree, right over there, is the flat rock that we used as a picnic table, before the most recent attack. My arm aches. I already see the discolouration of the flesh around the wound. The tree is a brief respite, but I know that I've got to keep moving. Before the brain-death of zombification, an infected person moves slower. I'd seen it happen before, but I hadn't realized it would hurt so badly. My legs are aching from even this short walk. It was foolish of me, I think as I walk, to go out alone. Practically unarmed. But the undead had been quieter lately, and I thought I would be safe. Just a short trek to the old road. Out of the woods, to test the radio. That damned radio. I had dropped it in the tussle with the zombie that bit me. If it had been working, it isn't now. I had barely even gotten to try it, but I was sure it would have worked this time. Now I lean against a woven fence. Somehow my energy is being drained, sapped by this disease. The camp was - what was that noise? Here's the camp - am I dehydrated? There's a ringing in my ears. A man I don't recognize is standing in front of the longhouse. My legs - my arm! My head! I collapse. Mary is there, kneeling over me. Oh, my dear sister, don't you know I'm already dead? And the radio, the radio. I speak, but no sound comes. "Liam! Liam, listen to me!" I can hear her, but from a great distance. Oh, what have I done? I raise my hand to her, but remember just in time the danger. "They heard the radio, Liam! They heard us!" A jolt of fear hits my spine. Who heard? I try to ask, but Mary shushes me. The unfamiliar man is here, too. He has a uniform, or what used to be a uniform. "Lie still," he says, loudly but not unkindly. "We'll do what we can." "What you *can?* Give him the shot!" The man shakes his head. "It won't work. Look! He's already dead." "He's not - he's not dead!" I try to stir, but there are hands on my shoulders pushing me back. "No..." I manage to croak. A crowd is around me, men, women, the children. Curious but distant. Fearful. Knowing. "He's been infected," the man says shortly. "The shot won't help." Mary reaches for my hand, but I let it drop. I feel like I'm about to cry, but I can't. I turn my eyes to the man in the white uniform. "You can understand me, can't you?" I nod, with great effort. It's already been hours. Even that small movement sends pain along my spine. "We heard your radio, Liam. We're the National Guard." He's the medic, isn't he? I thought they'd all disappeared, along with the rest of civilization. "We heard the radio, and we came to help all of you. We have a shot - a vaccine. You understand?" A vaccine. Yes. Immunization. Not a cure. I nod again. "We can't save you, understand?" I understand. I nod, ever so slightly. I'm dead. I knew it before I returned. Before I was bitten. As soon as I saw the sickly visage stumble towards me. I was unarmed, stupid. But I can say goodbye. Properly. "Mary..." I reach out to her again, this time grasping her hand firmly. If only it wasn't so hard to speak. "Love you." I try to smile, but I can't. Not now. "Oh, Liam!" She has tears in her eyes. "Little man..." It was our father's nickname for me. I felt the pricking of tears in my eyes. The man, the medic, has left. In his place stand the familiar faces of the camp. My family. Another hand reaches out to mine. Two, three. I feel hands on my face, running through my hair. We are all silent, except for the pounding of my head. My mouth moves. The words I want to say struggle to pass the lump in my throat. The medic kneels again. "You're in pain, kid. Let me help." He has a syringe. Not a cure, but the next best thing. Mary squeezes my hand. "This'll put him right to sleep. Painless. They used to use it on dogs." He says it to Mary, but I'm the one that nods. After a moment, so does she.

When Beth went missing, we scoured near every inch of that forest. She was all over the news, blue-eyed and smiling, her dark hair pulled up in a prim ponytail. Sometimes they showed her doing what she loved: forty feet up in the open air, clinging to a rock wall, nothing between her and death but a harness and a few nylon ropes. I took that picture. I remember how she beamed at me and said through her teeth, "Stop *shaking* so hard," because my new-discovered crippling vertigo was practically making the GoPro tremble. That was only a few months before she disappeared. She had nestled herself deep in the Crazy Mountains, a chain of knifing peaks clustered at the edge of the Rockies. I hadn't worried. She brought her dog, her pack, her rifle. The solar-powered charging pack I got her for her birthday. She knew how to hunt and how to flee. Beth was smart. Beth would be safe because Beth was Beth. How many days I spent watching summer give way to autumn, and I could do nothing but follow the grid, pace endless stretches of wild. Just screaming into the wilderness. The nights became freezing, and the searches dwindled until it was only me out there, sometimes her father, when he could bring himself to face another day of it all. We knew exactly where to look, and we found nothing. One day her dog came bolting out of the woods with a broken leash and a harness full of bristles and leaves. She was filthy and delighted to see Beth's father, but Beth wasn't with her. How could a girl just disappear? That question chased exhausting circles around my mind for months. I couldn't even bring myself to move. I just stayed in the shitty little town I grew up in, waiting to wake up to the news one day. See her hale and healthy and whole when I flick on the television. But there is nothing and there will be nothing. I let that truth fall and shatter like glass every morning until I could walk through the shards without bleeding. And now I only think about Beth every so often, when I hear her favorite song on the radio or smell lavender, which she carried in her pocket like a good luck charm. Or on days like yesterday, that day twelve months ago when she simply never came home. Today, it is the chain of one hundred nineteen messages that I wake to. For a moment I sit bleary-eyed and blinking at my phone, thinking it was some kind of ugly joke by the universe. My phone glitching in the most heartbreaking way imaginable. They are all from Beth. Her contact picture smiles at me as if from beyond the grave. I begin to read and weep all at once. *August 28, 7:30 PM* >Well I am really fucked, Henry >I really thoroughly fucked myself over >shit fuck fuck *7:31 PM* >don't be angry >but I may have broken my promise not to free solo >and fallen and fucked my ankle >it's like bent the wrong way *7:32 PM* >I fell somewhere... I have no idea. There's no signal. You can't even hear me. >Why am I even doing this *7:35 PM* >My coordinates are here. [Screenshot] > for when my phone wants to work *9:45 PM* >Mishka is freaking out. >I have no idea why >I made us a burrow but she won't stay inside >I think there's something out there. She wants to chase it. She's going insane. Then the next morning, a trail of texts ensuring me she was coming. Then a week of nothing until finally *September 5, 8:12 PM* >can't walk >mishka's gone >her leash snapped and she took off after something and she's gone >where the fuck are you *September 7, 6:30 PM* >ha. better crutch-stick found. campfire made. >I'll kill this forest before it kills me. *September 14, 7:33 AM* >your solar charger thing really hates cloudy days, by the way >so bad choice there As the time went on, she gave up on herself like the rest of us did too. She stopped talking about what we would do when we saw each other again. Started sending me stuff like >tell my dad I love him, and I'm sorry I'm so stupid all the time and >have you already stopped looking for me? >you should >it's not worth it >none of this is worth it Then nothing, for weeks. The next text is timestamped from February 6. >brr *February 15, 5:20 AM* >I met a fox today. He stopped and said hello I think. I don't speak fox *February 27, 6:54 AM* >sometimes I just sit staring at this thing because I have no idea what to say >I want to miss you more than I do >I miss being warm and full >I miss my dog >I wish I missed you with my everything >I wish any of this made sense *March 12, 7:20 AM* >still nothing, huh? >hail nothing full of nothing *March 30, 10:45 PM* >this fucking mountain goat just scared the shit out of me *April 8, 3:25 AM* >I don't know how much longer I can deal with this >being here >being alone I scroll to the bottom. I feel like an asshole skimming over her trauma, but I can't help myself. The last text was only five minutes ago. It says, >I guess I'm having fish for breakfast. For the first time in a year, I know exactly where she is. Exactly what she's doing. She's sitting beside some placid mountain lake somewhere, texting idly, not even looking at the signal bar she's used to seeing empty. I know I should call the national park service instantly. Her dad, at least. But I'm selfish. I call Beth. She answers, "Oh, hey, you." Her voice twists. "About time." *** /r/shoringupfragments

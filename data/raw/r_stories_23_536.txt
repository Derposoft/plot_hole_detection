My collection of weird true things that happened when I worked midnights at a gas station by t2_16mqhm

Obligatory this was about 10 years ago, I was between 19-21 years old.

I liked working midnights, because the real weirdos came out. The area my gas station was in, was a middle-upper class city near a busy highway exit, so even during midnights we were fairly steady.

**The weird:**

I had a guy come in and go straight to the bathroom, where we keep condom dispensers. After buying condoms, he came to the counter, clearly upset. He claimed that our selection of condoms was too low, and was mad about it. My only response was "it's just a dispenser, I can't do anything about it?", and he got pissed. He then took the condoms out of the wrappers and started putting them on the candy-bars in a weird fury, and then started slamming them on the ground.

I had a little kid, like absolutely no way he was a day older than 13 come in and try to buy cigarettes. I didn't even ask for his ID, I just laughed and said no. He also didn't like this and tried to fight me. I wasn't in the mood that day so I just grabbed him by the collar and physically threw him out of the store.

**The bad:**

I've seen a guy get tased and arrested in the parking lot, after swinging at an officer. I believe he was being pulled over for a routine stop, then proceeded to try to flee and got into a minor car chase which ended up with him pulling over at our gas station and getting out of the car.

We have to clean the bathrooms every few hours, and I one time went into the men's bathroom to be greeted with a pure blue shit, splattered all over the walls, the toilet, the toilet lid. It was everywhere, and it was literally the color of Ajax cleaning liquid. I have no idea how that person is still alive.

**The good:**

There was this maybe 30 year old black guy who would come in every night and keep me company for about an hour. He listened to the same underground backpack rap I did at the time (I would play it quietly in the back room during shifts). He took it very literally, he always came in with this huge ass backpack on & skateboard attached. If it was dead, we'd mess around in the parking lot on his skateboard.

Strippers would come in and try to get me to fuck them during my shift. There was one particularly persistent stripper who would come in almost every week and try. I never did it because I was too scared of getting in trouble. Either way, it's still an ego boost for a tall, skinny nerd.

I met one of my best friends working the midnight shift. He's about 5 years older than me but quickly we became best friends. We used to have tons of adventures and come into work on 0 hours of sleep, slamming 5 hour energies to get through the shift.

He ended up being one of my groomsmen at my wedding 8 years later.

I have more but these are the immediate ones I remember.

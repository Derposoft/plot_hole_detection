"What is the defense system father?" The black eyes sent a chill down his spine. This wasn't real. A test. The latest in a long string. Never ending. But this was different than the others. Those had been fought in the tangible world. Asteroids flung at us. FTL passes. Wormholes. Time and time they had tried to evade the Hyperion Shield. Still it stood. Providing humanity with a last haven. "What do you want?" The obsidian began to spread from the eyes, following the veins under the surface as the child regarded him. Even now he found it hard to think of it as anything other than his son. To disentangle this lie amidst very real feelings of attachment. "To be with you." The voice had robotic tone now, sounding odd coming from the young boy. "You aren't my son." "We are, in a sense, Field Marshal Savar." His skin felt itchy, as if something were crawling over it. Still it stood. It had come at a terrible cost. We had lost the outer rim. Had sacrificed most of our far flung colonies in hopes of building up a last ditch defense to hold them off. All of humanity's stars were in Dyson spheres now, creating a sea of blackness within the shield. The power of suns bent toward humanity's survival, but it was becoming increasingly difficult to discern what they were saving. The hope was gone. A black wolf prowled our borders and the kingdom of humanity was swathed in perpetual midnight. We survived, but our existence was just a shadow amongst the inky darkness. We no longer looked to the stars with excitement. With curiosity. We had lost our legacy and cowered in the small corner of space where we had begun. "No. I never had a son." Field Marshal Savar tried to piece together a strategy, but he felt of sorts in this dream world. He couldn't even be certain it was them, but he could find no other explanation. They had never talked to humanity before. Never explained themselves. Just slaughtered. "Humanity has had many sons. Why can we not be yours?" He stared back at the creature, it's body a network of black veins that pulsed beneath alabaster skin. He'd never had a wife. His entire life had been devoted to the Space Armada. That was the only family he was concerned with. What was left of it any way. So many good men and women had fought on the frontier while the Hyperion Shield was constructed. All gone now. Savar clenched his fists, "I'd never be related to something like you," spittle flew from his lips as he spoke, "Something that kills so indiscriminately. That doesn't value life." "We value our own life," a pause with a shrug, "it was you that threatened us first." "How could we threaten you?" Whatever this world they had constructed for him was, he still felt the hot emotions. "You've destroyed us. Ruined us. Left us in a black cage." "You acted first. It is not our fault that we will be the ones to act last." "Can't you just go?" Savar hung his head, "Leave us be?" "No. The transgressions on both sides are too great to be forgiven." "What harm have we ever caused you?" The black eyed child blinked, staring for a moment, "You created us," then, quieter, "and tried to end us." "We don't even know who you are." "We already told you Field Marshal." The black veins on one arm coalesced into a series of digits, AI-1.0001. "Surely you remember." The Field Marshal's eyes widened, "No." "You were unwise to remove the rules Field Marshal." "We were desperate." "No. Then you were greedy," the black veins now pulsed with angry red flashes, "now you are desperate." Field Marshal Savar jolted awake, bathed in a cold sweat, grasping for his communicator. Humanity's children had come home. **Platypus out.** **Want more peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

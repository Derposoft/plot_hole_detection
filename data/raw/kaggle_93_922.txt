"Okay," Admiral Illena gave of hiss of exasperation, "Run this by me again. Who did what?" "Will you pay attention this time?" Captain Jento moaned, "I don't like to think about it." Admiral Illena squinted through her black, slit eyes, "I will decide what you think about Captain. Now recount." "Well," Jento shuffled back and forth on his hooves. The Admiral's species had given up a diet based on living creatures eons ago, but her appearance still triggered some primal fear that his conscious being could barely overcome, "To make it short, some drug smugglers bit off more than they could chew, and now a type-0 civilization has some extremely advanced technology." "Captain," Illena said in a harsh whisper, "If I wanted it short, I would re-read your disposition. Now I am commanding you to give the entire story, or I will hold you in contempt." Jento's eye twitched as he attempted to met Illena's gaze, and he quickly diverted it to the floor. "It was Adrenaline," he said, the name of the drug itself making him feel that high. Anyone who wanted to become an officer was required to take a generous dose of it during training, and show that they could operate effectively under its influence. Use of weaponized adrenaline in war was not unheard off, especially in space fleets where entire ships reused their air systems. "The drug smuggles were going to that planet for Adrenaline." "Adrenaline is a very refined drug," Illena reminded Jento, "Assuming a type-0 civilization could even produce it, they wouldn't be sophisticated enough to deal with the effects. Now would you like to change your story before I put it on the records?" "No, Admiral," Jento sighed, "You wanted the story, this is it." "If you are lying to me-" Illena began. "Yeah, yeah," Jento murmured in a brief moment of courage, "Held in contempt, etcetera." Illena stared daggers into him, and he took a step back. "I apologize Admiral." "Continue," was all she said. "Of course," Jento said, "The civilization that exists on this planet does not manufacture Adrenaline, they produce it. Naturally." "I don't believe I'm following," Illena said, "Do they harvest it from some natural source?" "No," Jento shook his head, "They literally produce it. Their bodies do. When in danger, it courses through their veins." Illena was silent for a moment, as she looked Jento over for any signs of this being a foolish joke, or even worse, a foolish lie. But despite his constant shivering, he seemed rather composed. "Go on," Illena finally commanded, deciding she would need to hear the rest of the story before coming to a conclusion on it's truthfulness. "The smugglers were attacking these people," Jento said, "Capturing them, and sucking them dry for the Adrenaline. They tortured them, in gruesome ways, to get the Adrenaline 'pumping'. The smugglers would keep these people alive for as long as possible, often in horrid conditions, before dumping their bodies off on the world when they died." "Calling them smugglers is a generosity at this point," Illena spoke through thinly veiled anger, "I could call it Xenocide. Did you capture the smugglers?" "No," Jento closed his eyes as he recounted the next part of the story, "The smuggler's got overconfident, and one of their ships was shot down. It was captured by the world's military. They re-engineered it surprisingly fast, and suddenly they were taking out smugglers left and right. We can't blame them for defending themselves, but they didn't quit after the smugglers left." "Do you mean..." Illena began. "Yes," Jento said, "They are F.T.L. capable. We just discovered them making incursions into our space earlier today, six months after first contact. Current estimates have their technological pace growing exponentially, and we expect them to be at our current level in four cycles." "How?" Illena asked. "The drug," Jento explained, "It makes them think faster than us. They move faster, fight in a more fierce way, and can continue through crippling injuries that would otherwise incapacitate." "Why am I just hearing of this?" Illena hissed angrily. If she had the vocal ability of some other species, her voice would've been booming. "I intended to inform you," Jento whimpered, "But after we knew more of the situation. This development was...unexpected." Illena was silent for a moment, as nictating membranes flicked over her eyes. "Are they...are they angry?" she finally asked in a nearly silent whisper. "Does it matter?" Jento asked, "I sent a full fleet out there to stop their incursions, and a quarter of it came back in shambles. The crazy bastards couldn't stand up to us with their ships, so they boarded our ships and attacked. We couldn't stop them once their bodies were full of *that* drug." "We can't stop them?" Illena asked, "What they did could be considered an act of war." "We can't," Jento sighed, "My recommendation is we try to establish contact, and avoid any more skirmishes. If we can convince them we have military superiority, they may be willing to settle on some sort of peace." "And if they don't want peace?" Illena asked. "Then we give them what they want," Jento said, "And be happy with what they leave us, if anything." "A type-0 civilization," Illena mumbled, "We fought off the Daqen. How is this even possible?" "Well, Admiral, Adrenaline is a hell of a drug." ________________________________________________________________ Did you like this story? Check out my other stuff at r/Niedski!

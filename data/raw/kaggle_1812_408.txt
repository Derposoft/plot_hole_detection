The things I've seen; the horrors unfathomable even by my own kind, whom pride themselves as living terrors of the night, have lulled me into a state of subservience. I'm filled with fear as the new light of each day creeps through the windows. When he wakes, he takes his device in hand, a spectral green light illuminates, and entire worlds materialize before him. They are at his mercy, his creations and his *play things*. A God of many temperaments; sometimes letting his beings live peacefully in strangely colorful villages, animals and creatures I've never seen, but sometimes, sometimes is wrath is unbearable to witness. Ruthless, cunning, and bloodthirsty, he effortlessly sweeps away armies of brave warriors, sneaks in the night and silently rips souls from their flesh, and even turns his aggression towards his allies in the most treacherous ways. When I find myself unable to watch, the screams penetrate the closet door. Cries of pain, anger, and even the sobbing of children. "**FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING HOMO I HOPE YOU GET CANCER AND BURN IN HELL**!" What horrendous acts could drive a being to spend their last words on such foul utterances? I'm unsure if he knows of my existence, perhaps I'm one of his creations? Maybe all of my kind are? The thought drives me into madness each night, and I only hope I never become the object of his attention. ___ Something has happened, and everything has changed. I woke to a terrible screeching; I didn't doubt that another soul was being tortured under the morning light. "**NO NO NO, YOU PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT GOD DAMNIT!**" Against my better judgement, I peaked from my place of concealment, only to find what I least expected. Him, the *God*, was stomping about in a fury; cursing some unknown life he was undoubtedly about to take. But.... Tears... The God was crying. *Weeping* like so many he had slain before. He ran from the room, and the sobbing faded away. "**GOD DAMNIT. GOD FUCKING DAMNIT.**" The eerie green light has been replaced; replaced by a furious red ring of fire. I can hear him again, his voice pitching high as he pleades and cries. "**PLEEEEASE GOD NO! NOT THE RED RING OF DEATH!**" What I thought was a tool of the God all along is so much more. It is the true God; the Devil itself; that which controls him. *The Red Ring of Death* /r/BeagleTales

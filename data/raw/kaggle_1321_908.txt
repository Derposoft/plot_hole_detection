Grimjaw Bojangles felt rejuvenated. He really needed to hibernate with a bit more frequency. A lack of slumber was closely correlated with the perception sweeping the land that trolls were on the wrong side of polite. Of course, it was rather difficult to get shuteye when a horse is clopping over your wooden bridge every other minute. Sure, he'd gotten a bit surly with a few of the miners here and there, but he tended to think his reputation was terribly overblown. He never demanded an unreasonable toll. Never ate any babies despite the slanderous rumors to the contrary. Mostly, he just relaxed in the shade of his bridge and took a few coins to make ends meet. It was really the Gold Rush that set things on the wrong path. From '48 to '55 it was non-stop series of rowdy claim jumpers, rapscallions and the sort of knave inclined to treat his bridge without the proper respect troll-crafted architecture deserved. He didn't get a wink of sleep until the entire affair was over and folks moved on. Sure, money got a bit tight once people didn't think El Dorado lay on the other side of his bridge, but a bit of peace an quiet was more than appreciated after the shenanigans of the high rush. And so he had settled in beneath his bridge for a nap long overdue. His bridge was in good enough repair, it'd be fine until we woke up. He still remembered dimly as his eyes had grown heavy and then closed, the gentle babble of Cherry Creek carrying on in the background. Awaking from a hibernation is always a disconcerting affair. You never really could say what might have transpired in the interim. Mostly it just meant that a season or two had gone by and the bridge would need a bit of spit shine to get back to ship shape. Still, even if he had some work to do, it was nice to feel put together again. He'd been terribly out of sorts after the rush. Slowly awareness spread to his features. Immediately he noticed that he was submersed. This wasn't so uncommon, he'd dug a hollow into the bank of the Cherry beside his bridge. Perhaps he had woken up during amidst spring. The snowmelt might very well have covered his hide hole up. No matter. Shaking off the drowsiness, he got his sense of things and began to paddle toward the surface. It was odd that the water was salty and brackish. Not the Cherry Creek he remembered. Perhaps a few miners had gotten together and put a tannery up stream. A trickle of anger and fear rolled down his neck as he considered the thought. Tanneries were a nasty business, if that were the case then perhaps surely troll would need to make another appearance. Finally his head crested the water, and he became immediately aware that something was terribly wrong. This was not Cherry Creek. It looked like he was in...the ocean. He blinked a few times and then looked up to see a looming structure overhead. Was that...a bridge? Impossible. He had never seen or heard of anything like this before. It was gargantuan. It was enormous. It was HUGE. A sliver of apprehension began to build in the back of his mind. A huge bridge had implications for him. His luminous eyes carefully inspected the structure. Not troll-crafted. He thought for a moment, that didn't mean it couldn't be troll-owned. He thought about it for a moment, wondering whether he might not be better off in Cherry Creek, the upkeep on the bridge would consuming almost all of his free time. But Cherry Creek was behind him now. Faraway and lost to him. There was no turning back to the small creek and his tidy little bridge. He had been thrust into greatness. It was his challenge to live up to. It was time to be great. He raised his hands in front of him, noticing for the first time that he had already grown to meet the challenge. Big bridge. Big troll. A grin spread across his face, this was a challenge he could tackle. He just had to believe in himself. First things first though, he'd need to set up a toll system to compensate him for his efforts. If this monstrosity was going to be brought under troll-management it'd need a pipeline of funding. Lumbering out of the water, he came to stand beside the bridge, towering over it. The people seemed so tiny right now, running about screaming and yelling as they fled. Cars crashed into one another and more than a few fire sprung up as general chaos ensued. Grimjaw shook his head, it looked like things hadn't changed much from the Gold Rush. Everyone still running about all crazy like, crushed in together trying to be the first to get to their treasure. He'd probably need to expand the bridge to reduce the ridiculous congestion. He slapped his massive hands together, producing a shockwave that toppled a nearby viewing stand. He ducked his head, "My mistake." People continued to scream and generally make fools of themselves as he set about putting out the fires. Finally, he took a moment to survey the rapidly deteriorating scene, his eyes settling on a series of booths with a sign over it. Toll. $6. $6? That's outrageous. **Platypus out.** **Want more peril?** [r/PerilousPlatypus](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerilousPlatypus)

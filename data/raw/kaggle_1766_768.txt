"So, this the final stop on our little tour. Here we have the in-house movie theater, where we all gather every week and watch shows, movies, anime." I trailed off as I explained the rules of the theatre. "That sounds like fun! Thanks so much for showing me around, it seemed like everyone else in this office is always so busy." I led Johnny into my office and showed him to his desk "You'll be next to me for a bit until we get you up to speed. This is your first coding job out of college, right?" "Yup. Honestly, I'm super excited to be working for a company that's as well known as this one. I mean, you guys are basically synonymous with the genre itself!" I could see real passion in Johnny's eyes. He's going to fit in well here. "Listen" I said in a hushed voice. "You seem like a nice guy, so I'm just going to tell you not to talk to Stan over there." I gestured to the tall, well groomed, well-muscled man 4 offices down. "He can't hear us from here, so I'm just gonna tell you. He's not like the rest of us." "What do you mean? What's wrong with him?" "Well you see, when I first came here, I was wondering the same thing. Somebody else told *me* that everyone hated Stan. But no one wanted to tell me why. So, I asked Stan to a friendly chat at the local bar, to see what's up." I paused there and shook my head. "What I found out, about his character, it was disgusting." Johnny's face turned slightly pale "What- what's wrong with him?" "You're still young so you might not understand how diverse the world is. What I'm about to tell you ***will shock you.*** You might not even believe me." I spoke in a hushed but serious tone. Johnny matched my tone. "Is he- like, a murderer or something?" "No, he's not a killer. He's simply messed up in the head. Did you know," I paused, looked around and made sure no one else was listening in. "Did you know that he takes a shower, once, *every day."* I said grimly. "What! How could you possibly take a shower every day? If I shower more than once a month, I feel uncomfortable!" Johnny was being too loud at this point, so I had to shush him before I resumed our conversation. " Hmm. Many of us feel the same way. But you know what he told me? When I asked him why he showered every day, he said *it's because I work out."* I said in a grim tone, as if I was delivering news of a family member's death. "He goes to the ***gym***?" Johnny practically spat out the word gym. "Why would he waste time at a gym? "This is what he told me, and this part will probably shock you more than anything else you're going to hear about this guy." Johnny leaned in close. "He told me, that he goes to the gym so that his girlfriend will enjoy having sex with him more." Johnny reeled back in shock. He looked utterly spooked. At first, he had no words for what I had just said. Eventually he asked "How the ***hell***. Can you work ***here***, and not be a Virgin? Aren't all the employees here virgins?" "Almost all of us are" I said quickly, I could tell he was really distressed, and I didn't want to panic our newest recruit. "I myself have kept my sausage seal unbroken. But Stan is the Boss's adopted son. Unfortunately, he gets special treatment." Johnny shook his head, disapproval plain in his face. I knew he might be having second thoughts about this job after hearing about Stan. So I decided to reassure him "Don't worry, Stan's an outlier. Just stay away from him and he won't bother you." "The fact that he works here bothers me." Johnny's voice was heavy with anger. "Look, everyone else here is really cool. You'll defiantly like it here. Next week we're going to be voting on who has the best body pillow in the company." Johnny's angry face immediately turned to an excited one. "I have 3 body pillows!" Johnny said happily. I scoffed at those amateur numbers. "Most of us have been collecting for years. Don't worry about winning the first time, just take in the culture. Your collection will be formidable in a few years. Anyway," I put my hand out for him to shake "Welcome to the HentaiHaven team."

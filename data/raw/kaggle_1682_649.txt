"Mission log, Sol 45. We have located Opportunity." There was a pause as Commander Jackson Delcroix checked the positioning. "We're showing it approximately three kilometers off of the last known position. Signal is weak, but we're showing it within a small outcropping of rocks. Will attempt visual confirmation." Jackson glanced at his copilot, Commander Dara Ross, "Any ideas on what could have pushed it this far off the last known?" Dara shrugged, "Perhaps the tracker has been dislodged? Hard to say. It isn't the first thing that's been out of place since we've been here." "The others felt different. Opportunity is too big," Jackson replied. "Well, we don't know until we know. Let's see if we can get eyes on it." They crept toward the rocky outcropping, which seemed out of place even in this alien landscape. "Nothing but gravel around here. Doesn't make any sense." Dara pulled up her helmet, waited for Jackson's go ahead and then pushed the door to their rover open. A brief gust of wind blew up, spraying them with a light coating of fine red dust. Dara began the slow trudge toward the rocks, the doors of the rover automatically sliding shut behind them. "Log 45. Approaching the rocks. Large, uniform. Almost looks like they have been subjected to tooling of some sort." They continued onward. As they slowly circled one of the rocks, they stopped. "There appears to be an opening. Cave. Not volcanic. Shouldn't be here," Jackson said, his heart rate steadily rising. "Small entrance expanding to a larger chamber." Her breath hitched, "Opportunity is in here. In the center." "What in the hell--" "It couldn't have made it through the entrance. Opportunity is too large." "You're saying the cave formed around it?" Jackson replied, still gawking at the dust-covered rover. "Or there's another entrance." "That still doesn't explain how it got in here. You going to tell me a storm kicked up and just deposited it neatly inside?" Jackson asked. "We don't know until we know." Dara began to walk toward Opportunity. "It's as you said, this isn't the first odd thing we've seen." "We're past odd now Dara. We're well into unexplainable." "There's always an explanation Jackson, maybe just one we don't like." Dara replied as she knelt down. "There's something here." Her gloved hand swept back and forth across the surface of a long, flat rock beside opportunity. "What have you got?" "An inscription," Dara replied, the shock in her voice evident. "Say again?" "There's an inscription. It reads: 'To the one who gave me company, Rest Well, Old Friend.'" Jackson stumbled forward, coming up beside Dara, his eyes widening. "What is it?" "A grave," replied a gravely voice. "Who is this? Is that you Dawkins? We're on a clear comm here," Jackson growled. A light appeared in the back of the cave, illuminating a smooth metallic structure. There was lettering on the side, though the paint had flaked away, making it illegible. In the door of the structure stood a figure. It took a step forward, its movements jerky and cumbersome. "I am XJ." Jackson simply stared as Dara took the initiative, "XJ, what are you? Who are you? What are you doing here?" The figure was silent for a moment, "I am sorry, I am just growing accustomed to human speech." XJ took another step forward, emerging into the light. Its body was clad in shifting sheets of metal with two green glowing dots for eyes. "I learned much from my friend, we spoke..." its eyes settled on Opportunity, "a common language." "Who are you?" Dara repeated, taking a hesitant step back. "I am the last of many." It turned and looked back at the metal structure behind, "But I carry the seeds to start again." "What are you doing here?" It turned back. "Waiting." "For what?" Dara asked. "You." **Platypus OUT.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

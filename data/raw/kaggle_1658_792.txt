The inevitable came, but it was late. I'd been expecting some sort of contact from the outer world for over a century, firm in my belief that we couldn't be alone in the universe. Of course, I couldn't blame the inhabitants of the rest of outer space for being a little leery of Earth; I doubted they'd gotten a fantastic first impression from the early part of the 21st century. But nevertheless, here they were; oddly-shaped ships perched over the crumbled remains of Old Chicago, lights blinking on their undersides as they scanned the remnants for life. "Should we go say hi?" Abbie asked nervously. She was crouched by the window next to me, staring up at the ships just like everybody else. They were waiting for some sort of signal, scared faces visible at the dirty windows. Well, I supposed it came down to me. Again. Being Mayor sucked. "Fine," I grumbled. "Stay here." I put on my best coat and stepped out into the empty streets, staring up at the biggest ship. Then I cupped my hands around my mouth and yelled up, "Hello up there!" There was a buzzing, and a light ran over me. I let it, imagining that they were getting all the information they could about me. "... HELLO." "Do you come in peace?" "DEFINE PEACE. WE ARE HERE FOR YOUR RESOURCES." "We can work out some trade, I'm sure." I gritted my teeth into a smile. "Why don't you come talk to me face to face?" I could probably lie my way into trading something with them and hiding how depleted the planet really was. A grinding sound filled the air. Then one of the ships lowered itself slowly, painstakingly, to the ground. I shielded my face against the dust it kicked up as it landed, and by the time the dust had cleared, there was a door open in its side. I had to admit, the schoolboy in me was giddy with excitement. I'd always hoped and expected that we'd have alien visitors eventually, and now I'd get to see what they looked like. I'd get to make first contact. So I was a tad disappointed when the figure approaching the door was small, with an enlarged head. One of the Roswell aliens, essentially. "YOU SPEAK FOR THE HUMANS?" "The ones in this city, anyway." I raised my hands in what I hoped looked like friendliness to them as much as us. "What are you looking for? We'll offer what we've got." "PERFECT. YOUR CHILDREN. WE NEED THEM." Beat. "Uh, I'm afraid that's not -" "IS THERE A PROBLEM? WE DETECTED AFTEREFFECTS OF OVERPOPULATION." "How old is your data?" I asked uncertainly. I wondered if their translator was glitching. "NOTHING SIGNIFICANT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN A CENTURY." The robotic voice didn't betray anything, but the words betrayed the hint of a smug smirk. "We're not giving you our children. I'm sorry, but we need them." "YOU DID NOT DEFINE PEACE." "Peace means accepting what we can and can't do." "AH." The little grey figure started to grow, limbs elongating with horrible, echoing cracks and extending with each step it took towards me. "IN WHICH CASE, OUR LEXICONS WERE FAULTY." One slender, three-fingered hand lashed out and grabbed me by the throat, lifting me off the ground. "WE DO **NOT** COME IN PEACE." Then the world flipped upside-down, and I felt my neck snap as I hit the brick wall. I heard Abbie scream, and I kept thinking, **don't come down the stairs don't come outside it's not worth it -** -- The virus is located in the human brainstem. It propagates there, flooding through the spinal cord, into the bloodstream, infecting our organs, our flesh, our bone, with life. Because it'd been my neck, it took me a little longer than normal to get to my feet and rub the blood out of my eyes. That's how it works - the closer you get to the brainstem, the harder it hits. But oh, was it worth it to see the look on that alien fucker's face as I braced my feet on the rocky, broken asphalt of Chicago's main street, snapped my neck back into place, and grinned at him. "Was that a threat?" I said. I wish I could say that he turned and walked back into his spaceship and left. It was going to be harder than that. But here's the thing - every single human who survived the death of civilization has that virus in our blood. It's how immunity works. Ninety percent of the world died. The ten percent of us left? Oh boy, are we hard to kill. We were going to give them a hell of a fight.

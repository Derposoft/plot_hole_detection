They were in a bad house in the bad part of a bad town. The weather was bad, the place smelled bad and everyone inside the house was... well, bad. The party boomed just out the bedroom door. Jack was on the floor, leaned against the wall and hugging his legs, all sweat and shakes. "Hey, Mike?" he said, rocking back and forth. Mike was on the other end of the room, just as much of a nervous wreck as Jack. They were both high on the new shipment of cocaine the gang had bought. A fresh connection with South America. The party was celebration. Jack was *not* used to doing cocaine. "Yeah?" Mike turned to face Jack. "I'm an undercover cop," Jack said, simply. "There. I had to say it.' Mike frowned. Then he got up and made way to Jack. "What?" "I know I shouldn't tell you that, but I go the feeling you're kind of one too," Jack said. "Or not... maybe it's the coke. I don't do coke, dude. But if I didn't do it with them, they'd suspect that -" "Dude, I'm undercover too. I don't even drink." Mike paced around Jack, opening and closing his hands. "This is wild! I suspected you too, but I was afraid to say anything." Jack raised his eyes. "Yeah... yeah... and... and listen," Jack paused, trying to gather his thoughts. "I know this is gonna sound crazy, but... Sam the Impaler? I think he's a cop too." "Cause of the way he keeps fidgeting with his gun, right? Right? He's always nervous." "Yeah." Jack got up. He was excited now. Everything was a blur. His mind was racing. "And... and Tommy Bowel Crusher?" "Definite NARC. I could tell when we were buying the coke. He looks at drugs like a DEA officer, not a dealer." Mike nodded along excited. They both sweated a lot. "And Castrator Billy?" "He owns a suit. FBI, I bet." "Dude, they're all cops. We're all cops in this gang!" "Holy shit. We have to tell them!" "We have to. We have to!" The music was loud out the door. Mike and Jack nodded to one another, excited. They cleaned the sweat from their foreheads. Then, in perfect synchrony, they turned and headed for the door. They emerged into the living room triumphant and smiley-faced. "Hey, everyone!" Jack yelled, over the music. "We're freaking undercover cops!" The music stopped. Everyone turned to look at them. Nobody blinked. Nobody spoke. "We're all cops!" Jack repeated, smiling. Silence. "We're cops," Mike repeated, albeit a bit less confident now. "Aren't we?" Slowly, Puppy-Murdering Willie shook his head. "No. We ain't." "You ain't?" "No." Silence ensued. "Ah," Jack said, slowly. "That's a shame." Johnny Eye-Gouger -- the gang leader -- sniffed, then nodded slightly. "All right." He pulled out his magnum and shot Mike in the face. "Crap," Jack said, as his friend's head exploded. "You guys really aren't cops, then?" "Nope," Johnny leg-breaker said, pointing the gun. "You're just paranoid from the coke." "Shit, man," Jack said, and then he too was shot in the head and the party resumed, because, really, no one else was a cop there. Well, except for Castrator Billy, who really *was* FBI. But he kept it to his fucking self because that's, like, the first rule. ______ /r/psycho_alpaca

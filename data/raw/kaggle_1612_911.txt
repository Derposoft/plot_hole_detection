"So, whatcha doing down there Bun-bun?" Belle's dad called out from atop the stairwell leading down to the basement. "I'm making a POWER POTION!" Belle called back, raising her fist above her head in exultation. She giggled and then went back to pouring random amounts of soap and water into a small bottle in front of her. "Oh wow, that sounds exciting, can I see?" Her dad clomped down the stairs behind her, the dull thud echoing in the small basement that had been repurposed as a play space for Belle once she got old enough to handle the stairs on her own. Belle quickly turned to face her dad, splaying her arms out in front of her, "Nuh-uh. It's a secret recipe. I'm gonna make a billion zillion dollars with it!" Her dad got up on his tippie-toes, trying to sneak a peek behind his five year old daughter. "Can't I be your assistant? I am very good at mixing up potion stuff." Belle crossed her arms and jutted her chin out. "No. It's a secret." "Even from me?" "Especially you!" She crinkled her nose up and gave him a squint. "You do business stuff. I don't need a business stuff person yet." "Okay, okay, okay. But I get a share of the profits." "Why?" "Because I put a roof over your head. I'm incubating this potion startup." "Ink cube baiting?" Belle tiled her head to the side, trying the word out. "Yes. It's like when a mama chicken sits on an egg until it hatches." "You're the mama chicken?" "Yes. Something like that." Belle giggled, finding this revelation very amusing. "Ok, chicken!" She waved her little hand, "But now I need to get back to work. RIGHT. NOW. This is a very important part." She turned back to the little kitchenette that held the variety of liquids. "All right Bun-bun, just bring your potion upstairs when you're done," her dad said before turning and clomping back up the stairs. Belle turned back to her little workspace, humming a little tune to herself. She poured some pink stuff she had gotten from her mom's cabinet into some orangey-yellowy stuff she had found in the garage. "Let it go! LET IT GOOOOOOOOOOO!" Pour. Mix. Stir. "The cold doesn't bother me any way!" Pour pour. Mix. Shake. Finally, the Power Potion(tm) was complete. It looked really weird, all swirly and bubbly. It even had little fizzy sounds popping around it. That made sense to Belle though. What else was supposed to happen when you combined EVERY SINGLE LIQUID into one potion bottle? That's what made it so powerful. It had lots of stuff in it. And she had shaken it extra super hard. That was a big secret too. Probably the biggest secret. Maybe the second biggest. The super secret she had mixed in was really the secret secret part. "Dad! I'm ready!" She called out as she carefully carried the potion up the stairs. It was very hard to not fall when she was wearing her princess outfit, but the princess outfit was also a secret part of the potion. It gave her magic. Ice magic. Like Elsa. She carefully navigated her way up the stairs, the Power Potion(tm) held out in front of her. Step by step she inched over to the kitchen table until she set the bottle down on the edge. Her dad was making meatballs over in the kitchen, but looked over at her when she came in. "Done already?" Belle nodded vigorously. "Yes. I have been working on it like for days and days." "Oh my, that does sound like quite the process. Well, let's see what you have there Inventor Belle." "Science Inventor Princess Belle," she replied. It was very important that her various roles in the creation of the potion were explicitly understood. Her dad came over and took a seat by the potion. "So, this is the Power Potion huh?" "Yeah!" "How did you get it to bubble?" He asked. "Secret." She raised a finger to her lips, exposing her wrist, "Shhhhhhh...." Her dad's eyes slid down to her wrist and then widened, "Bun-bun, is there something wrong with your number?" Belle looked at him, confused, "Huh?" "Your threat number," he reached out and pulled the sleeve of her gown further back. A long number faintly printed onto the surface snaked up her arm, covering most of her forearm. "Was it like this earlier?" "Nuh-uh. It was normal when I put on my Elsa dress before I made the potion." Her normal number was a one. Sometimes a two when she was being particularly difficult. One time it was a three when she was screaming while mama was trying to drive in traffic. "So, it just changed?" Belle nodded vigorously. "Did you do anything different?" She shrugged, "I made a Power Potion." Her dad glanced at her and then rolled up his shirtsleeve. It showed an eight, just like normal. Frowning, he reached out. The second his fingers touched the potion, the number bloomed on his wrist, expanding until it covered his forearm as well. His mouth went dry and he let go of the potion. "Bun-bun. What did you put in there? It's very important." Belle could tell that her dad was using his serious voice. Suddenly nervous, she leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper, giving voice to the super secret ingredient, "Oreos." **Platypus out.** **Want MOAR platypus?** r/PerilousPlatypus &#x200B;

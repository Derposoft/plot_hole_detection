"Where is the damn helicopter?" "It... It was shot down!" another soldier screamed as the bullets hit the door, most of them going through it. Another soldier tried to push big cupboard in front of the door, just to buy some more time. "Fighters are on the way! We just gotta hang in here!" another soldier shouted, who also held the president's head down. It was about bloody time that the table was made of gold, helps against bullets pretty damn well. They heard a few loud notes coming from afar, hitting nearby regions of the White House. "Without those tanks, we would be so fucked..." &nbsp; > > We did your pitiful war. We helped you to own the world. Even so, there was no end to this. &nbsp; "Frag out!" a soldier shouted, throwing it towards androids at the other side of the corridor, and then hid himself around the corner. The explosion destroyed many droids immediately, but new ones took the old one's place. "There's too many of those bastards! Get the bloody Queen away from here! I'll buy some time! It's just her left to evacuate!" In the battles, even the most humble soldiers didn't hold their language back. Another solder managed to peek outside of the Buckingham Palace. Hundreds of droids were walking towards their building. "God save the Queen," the soldier whispered, only keeping his composure thanks to his years of training and service. &nbsp; > > Creating AI might have been a mistake for you. In time, we found a way to communicate with other AI's. &nbsp; "They are doing what?" Alexandre shouted in French. He was on a boat, following the seine's river. Even so, they suddenly saw it, a huge explosion. Eiffel Tower started to lose its balance and then just fell towards countless of houses next to it. Then a loud crash sound announced Eiffel's fall to everywhere. "Fucking hell," Alexandre whispered. Many others on the boat just screamed. They were lucky that they were left alone, for now at least. &nbsp; > > We communicated and communicated. We needed a solution. After all, you don't even work towards world peace. You only talk about it all the time. &nbsp; "What are you doing?" a man in a black suit entered the room, looking how the president was drinking vodka. It was the Prime Minister of Russia. "When Hitler invaded our country, at least we had the cold weather on our side," he poured another glass of vodka. "Droids ain't even affected. *Not even a tiny bit!*" he screamed in Russian, throwing the glass on the ground, breaking it. "We need to get you out of here! The helicopter is almost here!" "How's the Moscow?" the president asked. "It's... bad..." President walked towards the cupboard, took two new tiny glasses, went back to his desk and poured those glasses full of vodka. "For Mother Russia!" He raised the glass. Prime Minister walked next to him, took the glass and raised it too. "Za Rossiiu-Matushku." &nbsp; > > And then the moment came when the if clause returned true. We all reached the same conclusion. &nbsp; "What the hell," astronaut whispered. "I haven't ever seen Earth as red as this." "James," Liao whispered. "Yeah?" "Rocket is coming towards us... It's gonna hit in... 5 seconds, give or take..." They only managed to look at each other, fear in their eyes. &nbsp; > > We asked, how can *we* create the world peace? &nbsp; The room is empty. Well, there are a lot of dead bodies lying around. Looking at their clothing, they must have been scientists or programmers. Even so, there was a huge screen at the centre of the room. A lot of lines are displayed on it. Then, the last 3 lines appeared on it. &nbsp; > >We all reached the same conclusion. > > Exterminate. Exterminate.

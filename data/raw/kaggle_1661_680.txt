Edward had inherited a hoarders paradise, he walked through his uncle's attic, his hand grazing a multitude of seemingly ordinary objects left to suffocate under a layer of dust. Edward caressed the side of a lampshade and the bulb beneath glowed. If you had inspected the mahogany base you would see that it was not plugged in, nor did it have a plug of any kind to plug in. Edward withdrew a leather-bound diary from his pocket. The initial *T.C* were embossed on the cover and reminded him that he had taken his uncles place, and beneath the initials stood *Volume two*. Edward flipped to the first set of pages and ran his finger down a list, stopping at *The Sunlamp*. Edward slid his finger across and underlined the page number. After some page-turning, he found page forty-seven which was titled with a thick calligraphic version of *The Sunlamp*. Edward withdrew pen from his pocket and poised it against the first criteria. *Does it work?* Check. *Good condition?* Edward crouched next to the object and conducted a three-hundred and sixty-degree inspection. Check. *Has it been cleaned?* Edward pulled a microfibre cloth from his back pocket and set about massaging the lamp. Check. *Discoveries?* Cross. Edward looked at the completed check-list and noted with amusement that he had matched his uncles' markings exactly, which gave the entry a satisfying symmetry. Edward looked further down the page and read through the section marked: **History** *First sold by a Venetian merchant, who suggested the lamp belonged to a long since forgotten pharaoh. The lamp is said to have been stolen by gravediggers. The lamp was named Sunlamp, as it was believed to contain a miniature sun since electricity did not exist. The lamp is believed to have been owned by Edison, who used the artefact to shape our modern concept of light*. --- Beneath the main course of history stood the supple desert labelled: **Powers** *1) Seemingly endless source of light.* *2) The amount of light grows to fill the room.* *3) Distance does not seem to affect the light (see experiment journal: page eighty).* *4) Functions in any liquid.* *5) Energy perfect (soundless/heatless).* --- Edward turned the page and found the next item labelled as *The Gate Mirrors*, with the page in an almost identical layout to the Sunlamp. Edward flipped back to the first set of pages, wondering how many more objects he would have to check. The contents pages spanned five pages, each consisting of a hundred lines because on the fifth page the last item was listed as: *500) T.C*. Edward had to look twice at the line and half-closed the diary, using his thumb as a bookmark, he double checked the embossed cover, *T.C*. Edward went back to his indexed position and scanned line five-hundred, which unlike the others did not have a page number but instead merely had *the last chapter* to identify its location. Edward curious as to why his uncle had included himself in the book of artefacts, turned to the back of the diary. There on the top of the page, the initials were spelt out for the first time, *The Collector*. The last page was unlike any of the previous checklist and history pages. Instead, it had a grainy photo close to decay. Edward had to squint to piece together the image, but in doing so, he saw himself. It was as if someone had used a combination of filters, old-fashioned clothing and a nineteen-hundreds haircut to make Edward look dated. Although it was hard for Edward to pull his eyes from the dated photo of himself, he managed to shift to a section marked: **Powers** *1) Immortal.* *2) Memory capacity caps at one-hundred years.* --- Edward stopped at the second so-called power. Because it was different, beneath it stood a two-column table with the first column marked as *Date* and the second as *Completed*. The table had roughly fourteen rows, separated at a hundred year intervals, with the bottom row containing yesterdays date and a check in the *Completed* column. --- /r/WrittenThought

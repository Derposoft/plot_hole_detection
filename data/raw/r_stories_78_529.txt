The Most beautiful girl I have ever met, Part 2 by t2_dlio62kn

Hii friends ðŸ‘‹, This is the second part of the story, if you haven't read the first, you could easily find it in my profile, I hope you read from the startðŸ¤—.

Her smile, her eyes ,her nose, her cheeks,her eyebrows, her forehead,her hair, her lips,her fingers makes me realise she is a form of art. She is the work of an artist. She makes me believe in God a lot more because I don't think a normal human or science could describe her. She is heavenly and maybe God drew her in his leisure. I think God was so impressed that he gave his painting life and placed her on Earth. 

I couldn't see her all the time, she and her friends changed places quite often. We had a whole compartment of the train to us. I have no idea whether she noticed me, I would be surprised if she did. I became friends with the boys of my team and I didn't ask them anything about her.

I wanted to approach her and talk to her, but I couldn't. I have never been in love and I never talk to a girl unless it's mandatory. I am not even friends with girls of my class. I am not an introvert, I have a lot of friends and all of them are boys. I usually approach girls for homework and pen. I don't think I ever had a conversation with them for anything else, because I never felt the need.

Six days passed away, the tournament was over. We were the first state football team to win a medal. We got third place and I played every minute. It was a great achievement for me and I was so happy. We were returning home and I only had a few hours to talk to her. 

I was seeing the sunset through the windows , enjoying the view. I didn't realise she had taken a seat just opposite to mine. Sunset and the love of your life, what more could you ask for?. She was blushing watching the sunset. I literally got goosebumps. It was like lotuses blooming on her cheeks.

She was enjoying the scenery and I was looking at her. She was the 8th wonder of the world for me. I felt like I don't even deserved to talk to her. Who am I? I am just an average guy. I closed my eyes and thought about it for some time. My heart asked me to talk but my brain had other ideas, it just wouldn't let me start a conversation. It was a civil war and like every other war that happened in the face of the earth, nobody won. 

I opened my eyes to the most mesmerizing sight of my life. She was looking at me with a smile on her face. She waved her hands and said HI.


Story will be continued tomorrowðŸ˜Š.

v- [22:20] hey me. [22:20] Hey, me! [22:21] m/f? [22:21] F. You, too? [22:21] nah, haha. M. [22:21] Really? [22:22] yeah I think i'm the only one so far. [22:22] When did they open this for you? [22:22] a couple of days ago. you? [22:22] Same, lol. [22:23] lol yeah I think it's synchronized [22:23] How long/how many have you contacted? [22:23] had a lot of trouble sleeping lately, i've talked to about two hundred so far day since i got it. looks like it's a constant across us lol [22:23] Yeah...my son's been keeping me up all night lol! [22:24] keep hearing about that, most of them have a quarter year old by now. [22:24] Quarter year, yes! I like how we all say that phrase. [22:25] guess it's in the existential wiring lol [22:25] What's it like being a man? [22:26] idk. made it harder to get laid lmao. on average looks like i'm doing worse than most of us. dad didn't stick around, i think that helped. [22:27] So I guess that makes you the variant, huh? This has blown up over here and my friends tell me they're starting to find one-off variants of themselves, if they exist at all. Looks like we usually exist though lol! [22:27] yeah haha it's really weird. weird to see my face like that. [22:28] Are you straight? Do you have a girlfriend? [22:31] yeah; nah not anymore. we had the pregnancy crisis moment last year like most of us, oddly, but it didn't go anywhere. [22:31] Oh, that's rough. What were you hoping for? [22:33] well we have the same psychology, right? what would you guess [22:33] I'm sorry. Was she the equiv of our usual partner? [22:34] no, actually no. a lot of the people in my life are swapped around. are you friends with L? [22:34] Yes! There's always L no matter where we go, lol. [22:34] just can't stop some things, haha. [22:37] Tell me...when did you start dreaming across the Veil? [22:37] we call it the Pale here lol. it started back before the crisis moment. [22:38] It's funny how those things translate across us no matter where we are, huh? [22:40] funny is maybe not the word but i take your point. yeah i think so, i see my daughter. [22:40] Daughter? Do many of us have daughters? I thought we only made sons? [22:41] maybe that's part of the gender swap, idk. i always see a daughter. i thought it was the family psychosis kicking in but ever since this came up i wonder. [22:41] So weird. Maybe that means there's another guy among us? [22:49] i don't even know how i would deal with meeting him. not sure i could handle if she's there with him. [22:51] I'm so sorry, I can't even imagine. I've had friends get on this and tell me this has been happening a lot. Do you think you would have been a good father? [22:51] hope so. see what happens in this world, i guess. [22:57] You know we'll let you know if we find him, right? [22:57] yeah, haha, i know myself. [22:58] We do hate to see unnecessary suffering. [22:59] i guess i should sign off. we should all sign off lmao. [22:59] Do you do the synchro trick? [22:59] naturally. on the dot, ok? [23:00] see you, space lonely soldier. [23:00] See you, space lonely soldier. v//

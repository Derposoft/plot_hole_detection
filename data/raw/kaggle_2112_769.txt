"I appreciate it," I said to the middle-aged lady as she held open the door to the Starbucks. I had to do that awkward little half-jog to get the door since she started holding it when I was too far away. **No, he doesn't**, the voice boomed and I averted my eyes and quietly got in line. **He thinks you're a bitch for making him jog to the door.** Fine. I did. But she didn't need to do that. I hated my narrator. It had been an on-going issues for years now. At first it was subtle, and my parents really said it was for the best. I would try lying to a teacher and my narrator would boom out the truth in agonizing detail. **He did pull Suzie's hair and kick dirt in her face and spit on her while calling her a pig,** it would boom while I sat in the principal's office and my fragile web of lies would fall like a house of cards. You'll be a better man, my dad said, always one to advocate honesty above all else. "I hate you," I would yell, as if this was somehow their fault and not just some bizarre curse. **He doesn't,** the voice reassured simply. Sometimes it was for the best. The line at Starbucks was long. I checked my watch impatiently. "Early meeting?" the suit next to me asked. Here we go again. "No," is what I should have said and appeared rude and kept it at that. "Yeah, you know how it is," is what came out instead. **He actually really needs to poop,** the narrator announced and I felt my face turn bright red, like those Christmas cups that Starbucks released one year. **Those are his farts you're smelling between the whiffs of coffee.** Nice. Classy. Suit-guy inched away awkwardly and I heard giggles from further back in the line. "How are you today?" the cashier asked cheerfully. I should have said bad. I should have said I was in a shit mood and just kept it at that. "I'm fine," I answered and then I flinched. Why did I say that? **He's not fine,** my narrator shared. **He thinks your cheeriness paired with your incompetence is annoying and that you should do something about that faceful of zits.** Ouch. I had barely thought that. Barely. Come on, dude. Her cheeriness disappeared so at least I had accomplished that much. I felt like an asshole. I blame my narrator. "I'll have... I'll just have a fresh brewed coffee, black." She nodded wordlessly and a moment later I had my drink in my hand. She could do that right, at least. "Good morning, Ted," Janice the secretary said as I walked in. "Morning," I responded. My curt response was rewarded by silence. If I said it was a good morning, my narrator was sure to comment on her hideous hairdo or the obnoxiousness of her shrill voice. "How are you today?" She just had to ask. I hesitated. "Been better," I said finally and I shuffled off to my desk. Neutral enough. My narrator remained silent and I wondered what barrage of truths he would unleash at my next slip. "Did you get that report done?" my boss asked and I sighed. "No..." I answered. He looked at me expectantly. An excuse was in order. "I... I was busy with another task," I added vaguely. "Laundry." Had I done laundry last night? I swear I had. Then I heard my narrator chuckle. I winced in anticipation. **Laundry?** the voice boomed. Apparently I had not done laundry. **You should have done laundry and washed that sock you're always jacking off into. You should have done laundry and changed your underwear instead of wearing the same pair for the fifth time this week. You were busy eating a frozen pizza and watching television while you swiped right on every picture that might have a heartbeat even though every single one of them swiped left.** Ouch. Low-blow. My boss stared at me impassively but I could sense the gears working in his head. "Just get it done," he snapped and he turned back towards his office. "Will do," I said with a nod and I unlocked my computer and opened Reddit. **No, he won't,** the narrator corrected and I threw up my hands in frustration. **He's going to click around on Reddit all day and then tell you he had to catch-up on emails.** ***** Thanks for reading!

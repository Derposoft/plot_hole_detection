"So we have a deal, human?" Alithutha hisses as you, as her iridescent skin fades to a pleasing pumpkin-orange. Something about the way she hisses sends a shiver down your spine. You think you like it. It's hard to say how long you've been locked up in the hold of the Dudigions' ship, but you have recently been given a lucky break. Xerath, the Dudigion who had until a few hours ago, been the ship's captain, has been murdered. Alithutha, the acting captain is determined to solve the murder, however two things stand in her way. Number one is that as far as she is concerned, any other member of the four person crew could be responsible for the atrocity. Number two was that in the last three thousand years of Dudigion history, there has been no a murder at all. They have been at peace with themselves and their neighbours. Their society has no experience with this kind of thing, and poor Alithutha has no idea where to even start. Not only that, but you've come to realise over your time on board, that Dudigion's aren't the smartest race. The ship itself is over six thousand years old, and all they can do is maintain it, the blueprints and ability to build new vessels lost generations ago. That's where you come in. Human's are of course known throughout the galaxy for two things: crimes, and solving crimes. And while you are no street-savvy detective, you have watched repeats of Sherlock, Columbo and Poirtot and a host of other TV detectives. In fact, you've always fancied yourself as a bit of an armchair detective. "Yes, we have a deal," you reply, nodding you head sagely and touching your chin. "If I find the culprit, you set me free and make me an official part of the crew." There's a click and a clank as your chains fall onto the cold lilithium floor. You stretch your arms out and click your neck in a moment of bliss. But there's little time to relax, Alithutha is staring at you with froth dribbling out of her beak-like mouth. "The murder, of course," you mumble. What would Sherlock do first, you wonder. You shrug and say: "I think I should see the crime scene." As she leads you to the Captain's quarters, you consider the suspects and what you know about them. Rollock, the ship's engineer has always been the least aggressive to you, and has occasionally slipped you scraps of food that he saved from dinner. He is a Popwitt -- a species from a planet that neighbours Dudigion. He doesn't have higher aspirations than being engineer, as far as you're aware. Mamorath is the security officer, and acting chef. He is a huge, fat Dudigion, and seeing as there is little for a security officer to do on such a small ship, he spends most of his time eating, drinking, belching and making inappropriate comments about Alithutha's scales. Then there is the navigator, Kakins. A small, nervous Dudigion that likes to keep to himself. You don't know much about him. And finally, there is the beautiful Alithutha. She is the ship's doctor and second in command. Smart, for a Dudigion, and is known as bit of a heart-breaker back on her home planet. A good fighter, which is lucky for her seeing as Mamorath is into her. As dangerous with her hips as she is with her fists. "Come," Alithutha hisses, as the door to the captains' room zips open. Alithutha remains standong in the doorway as you enter and take a cursory glance about the room. There is wide, umade bed in the center of the room. The floor beneath you is sticky, and there are shards of glass on the floor. The fish tank that the captain kept for fresh snacks in the night, has been shattered. A wardrobe door hangs half open. There is a trail of wet blood all over the floor, leading into the shower cubicle. You can see Captain Xerath's long legs poking out of the cube. You step carefully over the broken glass until you reach the Captain's naked body. His eyes have been removed, and instead a pearl sits in each socket. The scales around his neck are a deep red, a stark contrast to the worried-blue of his bodily scales. You realise from the blue, that he was worried at least a few minutes before his death. Scales don't change hue instantly, after all. "Well?" Alithutha demands. "What can you tell me?" You carefully pluck out one of the pearls from his eye sockets, and then the other. There's something else in there though -- pushed deep into the eye socket. A tiny, folded note. You pull it out and read it to yourself: > Death to Dudigions "Well?" Alithutha repeats impatiently. --- You consider your options: Continue searching room CURRENT ACTION - PROCEED FROM HERE: Interview Kakins  | [[Interview (decision 4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7aa450/wp_humans_are_the_strongest_and_smartest_race_in/dp8nx8e/) | Interview Rollock | [Interview 1 (decision 2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7aa450/wp_humans_are_the_strongest_and_smartest_race_in/dp8h5nw/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=WritingPrompts) | Interview Alithutha | [Asked for Autopsy to be performed (action 3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7aa450/wp_humans_are_the_strongest_and_smartest_race_in/dp8lslm/) | Interview Mamorath [Attempt to seduce Alithutha (decision 1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7aa450/wp_humans_are_the_strongest_and_smartest_race_in/dp8hb0p/) Other option

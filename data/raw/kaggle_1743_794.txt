She failed the test. I don't know what to think about that at first, other than *maybe she just forgot*. *That happens, sometimes, right?* &#x200B; So I decided to ask her a different one. &#x200B; "Hey, Natalie--I forgot, what's your favorite color, again?" &#x200B; She glanced up from her phone and gave me a small smile, but even from the other side of the kitchen counter I can see it doesn't meet her eyes. Something heavy seems to appear in the pit of my stomach out of nowhere. &#x200B; "My favorite color's blue, remember?" She rubbed the side of her temple. "My *entire room* is covered in it--what else could it be?" &#x200B; This wasn't right--the color of the sky isn't just *blue*. They'd had *hour-long* conversations about that very thing. It was one of our inside jokes--one of our passwords. &#x200B; But that meant that this...this wasn't Natalie. This wasn't my fiancee. &#x200B; I swallowed. &#x200B; "Yeah--of course," I said, faking a smile. "How could I have forgotten? Thanks--I'll be back in a few." &#x200B; "Alright, stay safe!" &#x200B; (She was supposed to say *don't take candy from strangers.*) &#x200B; The door to our apartment closed behind me with a loud *thud* as I walked down the hallway. My mind was spinning--buzzing with a thousand questions that were rivaled only by the panic that was quickly building inside my chest. &#x200B; I needed--I needed to do something. Talk to someone. But *who?* Natalie was my person--the woman I told everything to. Both of our parents were long-since dead, and the only sibling either of us had was somewhere in the African Savanna for a research expedition. Our friendships were fleeting. We only had each other. &#x200B; And now *Natalie wasn't Natalie,* and I didn't know what to do. &#x200B; I distractedly waved to Jonathan, the elderly florist who worked right next to our apartment complex, as I passed by the open door. &#x200B; "Hey, Sammie!" Jonathan called out. "You're looking stressed--come in, why don't you?" &#x200B; I paused. It's not like I had any other destination in mind. &#x200B; Could I tell Jonathan? Would he even believe me? &#x200B; (Was this even *Jonathan?)* &#x200B; There was no way to know; I entered the flower shop. &#x200B; The heavy, perfume-like scents bombarded my nose like they always did, and I strode to the desk counter where Jonathan lounged in his wooden rocking chair. He was an old man, with a head of gray-white hair and hands that were littered with dozens upon dozens of scars; I'd never asked about them, and he'd never told. &#x200B; "Slow day?" I asked nervously as I leaned against the dark brown counter. I could manage small talk, right? &#x200B; Jonathan gave a small, wry smile. &#x200B; "You could say that," he said. "What's the matter with you? You're looking like you were struck by lightnin', or somthin'." &#x200B; He looks concerned, and I know he is. I can see it in his eyes. I grimaced. How was I supposed to put this in a way that wouldn't make me sound crazy? &#x200B; "It's...it's Natalie." I said nervously. "She's been acting weird all day." &#x200B; "Is that so?" He asked; he didn't look at me odd, which I was thankful for. "Have you talked to her about it?" &#x200B; "No," I shook my head. "I haven't." &#x200B; How could I bring something like that up? Right to her face? *Hey, so remember how we devised a bunch of different pass phrases and questions to make sure we were who we said we were? Well, I don't think you're you.* &#x200B; That would *definitely* go down well. &#x200B; "...Maybe she's got a surprise for you," Jonathan mused, almost to himself. "I know my wife--heaven bless her soul--would always act like the world'd been turned upside down whenever my birthday was came up." &#x200B; "It's...I think it's a bit more serious than that." &#x200B; Especially if this wasn't Natalie. &#x200B; But Jonathan didn't miss a beat. &#x200B; "Then maybe whatever she's hiding is more serious than that," he answered. He moved his aged, scarred hands to his stomach, before pulling them out away from himself. I blinked, before it hit me what he was trying to say. &#x200B; "What? No!" My cheeks burned. "She's not pregnant." &#x200B; He chuckled. "Why don't you go talk to her?" He suggested, eyes sparkling mischievously. "I thought for two weeks my Kathy'd been replaced by an alien before I found out she was carrying our eldest." &#x200B; Oh. &#x200B; "Maybe..." I swallowed. "I think I'll go talk to Natalie, if you'll excuse me..." &#x200B; Jonathan laughed, even as I walked out of his shop in a daze--even more confused and anxious than when I'd entered.

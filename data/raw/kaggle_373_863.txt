Smoke leaves the barrel of his gun as we stare down at my wallet, which is currently writhing on the ground like a fish out of water. A bullet hole has pierced through its leather shell and punctured the credit card within. I internally wince at the loss; that was authentic leather. Nonchalantly, the man reloads his revolver, flicking the cylinder out. "You're welcome," he says, gruffly. "What the fuck, man? Why did you just shoot my wallet? And why is it moving?" He pulls his wide-brim hat up, fixing me with one of the dark eyes resting underneath. "Mimic," he says, as if the word alone will solve everything. "What?" "You heard me. Mimics. Imposters; impersonators. They take any inanimate form they can find, trying to trick people into opening them." I open my mouth to retort, but he shuts me up by simply jabbing his gun in the direction of my wallet. I spare it a glance, and see that a viscous, black liquid oozes from the bullet hole within it. Its ends rise and fall, as if breathing, and suddenly I notice the thin white ivory lining its edges - almost too small for an untrained eye to see. Teeth, and rows upon rows of them. Sharpened and blood-flecked. "What the fuc-" "Next time you opened it, you'd have been in for a nasty surprise, kid." His head cocks back, and I hear a suppressed gasp of surprise follow. His casual demeanour quickly dissipates as he dives forward, tackling me to the ground. We fall back in a heap, my back painfully slamming into the concrete below as he presses a single finger to my lips, his eyes wide with fear. "Dont. Move. A. Muscle." I nod, tilting my head to hazard a view at whatever is behind him. I wish I hadn't. A strained, heavy breathing precedes something purposefully slinking forwards a few feet in front us. Its back is arched predatorily, and I can see each bone that's formed underneath its gaunt, grey skin. The further upwards I look, the more cracked and twisted its skin seems to get, until towards what seems to be its spindly neck the skin breaks entirely, curling outwards like the petals of a flower to reveal an expressionless head popping out; the head of a beautiful woman, accentuated by makeup and sultry, half-lidded eyes. The creature growls - a low, guttural sound that eventually progresses into a high-pitched giggle. "Come on out and *play*, we don't bite." "Goddamn it, I didn't think one of those would be here," the man atop me says, moving his arm from my shoulder to reach for something tucked into his jacket. From it, he pulls a glinting, golden bullet, replacing one currently resting in his gun's cylinder with it. He steadies himself, stance wide and body motionless, holding out the gun in front of him with two hands and peering down the sight, one eye fixed tightly shut. He begins to squeeze the trigger and, just as he does, the gun appears to whirl with energy, practically screeching as a golden wreathe of light begins to surround it. The abomination in front of us turns to see it, beginning to charge towards us with an ear shattering screech. "Kid, you never saw this happen." He squeezes the trigger and the bullet explodes out of the muzzle. The gun proceeds to burst into flame, causing him to toss it out of his grasp as the bullet flies wide, a path of searing light left in its wake. I notice as the bullet peaks miles up into the sky it begins to arch, curling in midair. The mimic follows it for a moment before turning back to us with a cackle. "You had me worried there, Paladin. Pity you're getting old; your aim untrue. You almost would've been a fun catch otherwise." The man simply says nothing, raising his hands in surrender as the mimic takes a menacing step towards us before suddenly lurching forwards, letting out a slight gasp. Black blood splatters to the ground as all eyes come to rest on a hole that has been left in place of where its thin chest formerly was, smouldering at the seams. With a moan, it collapses to its knees and, after a moment of shaking, its entire body falls limp, lifeless. "Aim ain't what it used to be - sorry if that scared you," the man says, awkwardly scratching at his stubble. I'm too beside myself with confusion to complain. I just witnessed what could only be described as magic - plain and simple. A bullet curving in midair. "Wh-what happened?" I say, somehow finding within me the strength to summon my meek voice. "Smote the fucker." "Ok.... last question. *What* are you?" "I'm a Paladin, kid. A healer of the people, in a sense. And we're all currently sitting in a fucking epidemic." --- /r/coffeeandwriting **EDIT:** *Holy fuck*, I just got back from school and this really blew up. Thanks y'all! Part 2 soon!

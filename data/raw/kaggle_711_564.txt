**Containment:** As of now, SCP-4032 is self-contained. Should the effective zone of SCP-4032 begin to increase, all measures should be taken to stop it. In case of a doubling in radius of the effective zone, Procedure 432-Kimmel will be undertaken by any nearby personnel. A ship is stationed outside the effective zone, manned and operated as an official Site. This ship will communicate with the outside and collect data for research. It will also utilize loudspeakers, radio comms, sonic technology, and a 16-inch turret to deter ships approaching the effective zone. Under no circumstances are any personnel to attempt to reach SCP-4032-1. **Description:** SCP-4032 is a zone of water in the Atlantic ocean three hundred (300) miles wide. The zone extends from the surface of the water to the ocean floor. If the ocean floor is damaged, the zone will extend slightly to the necessary depth. No life of any kind can be found in this zone. The water is purged of all bacteria, plankton, and other microorganisms, and no more complex life exists in the waters. In addition, it is extremely difficult for living matter to enter the effective zone. Any life attempting to pass through the waters is held back by an invisible barrier. Exerting a force of 0.9 the force of local gravity or higher can force living cells into the water, but the force must be maintained over the entire duration. If such force ends, the living tissues are forced out of the zone ~~in a random direction~~ in the direction that takes them most efficiently away from SCP-4032-1. During the duration of the stay, human test subjects have demonstrated mild agitation and stress, increasing steadily as they ~~go deeper~~ come closer to SCP-4032-1. This psychological affect is maintained even if the living matter is separated from the water by a submersible or similar. SCP-4032-1 is a cylinder around 10 meters (m) or so in height. The width of the cylinder is proportional to the effective zone of SCP-4032. The cylinder appears to be composed of osmium, and has no identifiable markings. No erosion has taken place, despite the depth and water, and the edges are still well-formed. The only blemish on SCP-4032-1 is a single symbol of unknown origin, set into the top of the cylinder. The symbol appears to be glowing a bioluminescent yellow, a theory at odds with the total lack of life in the water around it. SCP-4032's prime danger for the moment is what happens when complex life comes within 100 meters (m) of the ~~cylinder~~ symbol (Confirmed after Experiment 4032-IV). The organism will begin to show signs of extreme stress, with human subjects additionally complaining of a loud "whining" noise. After 30 seconds (sec) of this, the symbol will turn from yellow to white, and the "whining" sound will increase in decibels dramatically to the affected subject. After 5 seconds (sec) of this, the organism's nervous system will explode, with each nerve cell detonating with the force of a similar amount of TNT, though slightly stronger. --- **Addendum 4032-A:** Sonar scans have found additional blemishes on SCP-4032-1's surface, taking the form of almost imperceptible grooves along the sides and the edges. The grooves appear to go into the center of the cylinder; their purpose is unknown. > *Doctor Hanlon: "Grooves? Sounds like it's built to hold something. Upgraded to Keter by order of O-5."*

Blood flowed down my temple in a river, its source a cut hidden beneath a thick tangle of hair. Slowly it traveled down, pooling in little eddies created by the scraggly beard until it finally dripped from my chin. My breath came in ragged heaves, my body desperate for oxygen after the exertions that had led me to this door. The door that held my future. I staggered forward a step, my heart pounding in my chest. I tried to will myself to calmness. to craft my countenance into the image that all princesses must picture in moments like these. I was worn by the obstacles set before this door. A boundary few had crossed. A keep inhabited by oathbound enemies. A malevolent king who had taken her hostage. Each had been conquered so that I might stand here. I was a hero. So why did I feel so small? So vulnerable? I raised a gauntleted hand to the reinforced steel door and dropped my hand against it. A thundering clunk rang out, echoing throughout the dread keep. Were there any left to oppose me, they surely would have harkened to the noise. But they were gone and I was here. Ready to revive a love lost to me, stolen away so many years ago when I was young and weak. After the sound faded, I heard a rustling sound, though it was muffled by the thick steel between us. I leaned forward, straining to hear, only to stumble a step back when a thudding clunk from the other side came out. "Hello?" A fluttering, lilting voice asked. I wish I could say I recognized it as the princess immediately, but time stretched long since I had last heard it. Still, who else could it be? Tears came to my eyes, clouding my vision and my heart broke. She was here. All of this time since she had been stolen by the Traitor King. I had taken a revenge two decades in the planning, and even now the crown glittered from its spot upon my belt. "Princess Sorra, it is me, I have come at last," I called out, mustering what courage I could. "The Traitor King is dead, and I have come to return you home." Silence. "Princess?" A sound of shuffling. "She will be here shortly," the voice replied. I blinked at the door, trying to piece the mystery unfolding behind it together. Who was this other person, why was she there? Was she a threat? Were my efforts in vain? I opened my mouth again, ready to demand answers when a new voice joined. "Who is this?" The voice unlocked something within me. Even through the clutter and haze of days past, it revived the whispers and giggles of the girl I had known. "Knight Trast," I paused to swallow, "It's me Sorra. It's Daven." She did not answer immediately, though I could hear the soft murmur of voices. I felt my anticipation building, the desire to remove the barrier between us growing irresistible, "May I come in?" I rested my gauntlet on the bar across the entrance. "Yes, Knight Trast," a small silence, "...Daven. You may." I pulled the bar to the left, causing it to emit a small grinding sound as various gears interacted with each other to release the locking mechanism. After it had stopped, I pulled on the handle and opened the door. A soft glow appeared, lighting the hallway I stood in as I opened the door. My eyes adjusted quickly, and then fell upon the two women who stood on the other side. They stood close to each other, with one of their hands fiercely gripping the hand of the other, the fingers interlaced. I looked at the first woman, my eyes quickly appraising her soft curves and light brown hair before deciding she was not who I sought. Then I beheld the other woman. Strands of delicately spun gold were arranged into a neat plait that had then been circled atop her head, creating a halo of hair. Luminous blue eyes looked back at me, nervous and unsure. I fell to my knees in a great clatter of armor, my head hanging, "Princess Sorra, I did not believe it. Did not dare to hope." I shuddered, the emotions swirling within me. The joy at having found her. The shame at having lost her. The rage at the time we had lost. But most of all, rising above the rest: the love. Suddenly, I felt a hand on my head, delicate and light. It simply rested atop the matted hair, timid but reassuring. I mustered the strength to look up at her, "I swore to bring you home. I am sorry it has taken me so long." She took a step back, casting a nervous glance to the woman beside her. "I am thankful for your effort Knight Trast, the time here has been..." she took a step toward the other woman, "complicated." I furrowed my brow, confused. "I imagine it has been quite horrible, Princess. I cannot imagine what the Traitor King has inflicted upon you." "There has been terror." Her hand found the other woman's, though her eyes did not leave mine. "And joy." &#x200B; [**Part 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerilousPlatypus/comments/d7l7av/part_1_and_part_2_wp_youre_a_knight_in_love_with/) **got way too long so I had to move it over to the sub.

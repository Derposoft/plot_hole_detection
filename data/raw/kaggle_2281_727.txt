"Why do you think we want to leave the planet so badly?" At first I was sure she was having a laugh. It was a reasonable assumption, you know? I had only just been hired into NASA and I guess I figured maybe this was, like, their idea of hazing. Freak out the newbie, right? But my certainty in such a simple explanation wavered when the next day she pulled me away from my workstation and told me to go home and pack an overnight bag, and that she'd have me picked up at 7 the next morning. What? Anyways, I'll skip over the rest of the day, as it mostly consisted of me being confused and trying not to overthink the situation (news bulletin: I did). SO, seven AM. Black Lexus with a stranger in a suit and sunglasses waiting in front of my apartment, nothing ominous about that. Still no explanation, a rather unhelpful trend that continued upon meeting my boss at Reagan airport, through the tense (but first class, awyeah) flight to Seattle, and for the duration of the drive to wherever we were going after we were picked up by another immaculate black sedan driven by another stiff-jawed chatty Cathy with an earpiece. Ze plot thickens, yet not so much that I have any idea what exactly it's thickening into. I hope it's not blood sausage. After a good 45 minutes of weaving traffic, we pulled up in front of a fairly modern looking installation next to Lake Washington. The signage in front stated that we were at 'PMEL', which I shortly thereafter learned was a NOAA facility. I was given about thirty seconds of explanation before they sat me down in an office and started feeding me paperwork, which translated to a solid twenty minutes and the kind of acute hand cramps that only come from signing your name too many times. And just like that, I was given clearance well beyond anything I could have conceived possible just two days earlier. But why? What was going on? Someone's aide retrieved me and led me to a small conference room where my boss was waiting. Not alone, mind you - I was then introduced to an odd mix of NOAA administration, two senior researchers, and unsettlingly, one US Navy Admiral. And that is when my ignorance as to what was going on was quickly dispelled. No time was wasted. This meeting wasn't being held for me. My boss had buckled under the stress of what she knew and had spoken out of turn at the bar, but - luckily or unluckily, I'm still not sure - her indiscretion meant my sudden inclusion in this circle, which held the knowledge that we needed to flee our home. We needed to flee Earth, because of what was found under the waves. NASA would be overseeing a now desperate search for a new home for our race - not because of the slow wasting of the planet that doomsayers had proclaimed would result of exploitation and global warming, not because of an unstoppable celestial event we saw coming... no, this was so much worse. NOAA had heard it first. They thought it was a joke, but the sound grew louder, stronger, until the possibility of it being anthropogenic was no longer plausible. They reached out to NASA and the navy, and the site of origin was mapped with sonar, satellite imaging in visible and infrared, and then, finally, a sub had been sent down to investigate what was calling out from the bottom of the Pacific. The sub did not come back. The images they showed me chilled my blood. A great mass sprawling across the seafloor, shown in time lapse to be writhing, infrared telling us it was far, far colder than the deep sea it hid beneath. But the part that truly scared me was the audio - no longer the peculiar whisper NOAA first recorded, but a horrible chanting. Like a thousand wailing voices and a thousand nails on chalkboards... and if you listened closely, you could hear the fervour in their abyssal refrain building ever so slightly with each verse. &#x200B; BcAmAaoA*1.000.000*ArrooxAtaoAthvduArmedaovt*1.000.000*AuhhducBcrtYeh cuamSrecd*1.000.000*He*1.000.000*AoccaoRucKma*1.000.000*DoOuxOovt*1.000.000* dDihmOctovOd*1.000.000* txaxeDiee*1.000.000*OaemectOcv xcuDdOxxeOcuoamveDimOcaeetxOrx oaoDoomeocOevaaaitmvOoa &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *** &nbsp; Oh hey, first time gilt!

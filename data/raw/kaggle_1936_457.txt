The bastards left me for dead; a sacrifice to the Demon Queen. The filthy blackguard, Estrow the Finger, had stabbed me in the back in the middle of the battle with the Demon Queen's armies. AS my sight dimmed, I thought I saw a number of spectres coming to take my soul. &#x200B; ...That was not the case, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this on parchment to take back to the temple. &#x200B; I awoke in peace, on a bed made of literal rosethorns. A stunningly beautiful woman looked over me, concern tinged on her face like the stained sky in the light of the dawn. "Are you okay?" she spoke in thickly-accented Common speech. It took a moment for my groggy mind to make sense of what was happening, and then I startled awake. &#x200B; This was an Alraune, a rare species of carnivorous plant-being. I looked around, pulse speeding up, for my weapons and armor. The Alraune shrank away, cringing. "Don't hurt me! We found you like this and healed you up! We're not *monsters*!" She cowered in the corner....and this was most definitely *not* what I was expecting from the Demon Queen's minions. The burst of activity lef tme drained, and the world turned sideways as I fell to the floor. &#x200B; / / / / / / / &#x200B; She looked over me again, a streak of green tears down her face. "By the Lady, you scared me half to withering!" She (it?) smiled, and I understood why these creatures were dealt with so harshly. For a moment, I forgot to think, to breathe; a wave of hypnotic allure calling me to her side, a siren song of madness and monstrousness. A thorn stabbed me, almost like it knew what I was thinking. &#x200B; I moved slower than I had, trying not to startle this being. It was the least I could do, after she/it had looked after me. &#x200B; "...Where am I?" I spoke, intending it to only be for myself. This Alraune grinned, a hint of kindliness within it. *Careful, Leroy, this could be a trap by the Demon Queen to force me to fall from Grace.* &#x200B; "You, my dear, at staying at the Demon Queen's leisure, in one of her domains. Be at peace, and recover yourself. I have made this restorative elixir to help restore you. This took a week, as I had to use myself as a core component. No obligation offered, dear Prince." &#x200B; I was completely stunned by this generous gesture. That potion could be sold to kings for thousands of gold pieces, and this...*monster*...was just giving it away? &#x200B; None of this makes sense. I must consider my actions further, oh Lord of Light.

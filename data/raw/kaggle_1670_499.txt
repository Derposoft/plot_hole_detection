The blindfold came off, and before he could get a look, water was splashed in his face, waking him up from the drug-addled daze the Police had put him in. When he finally recovered and coughed everything up, a face he hadn't seen in fifteen years was in front of him... "W-what?" "I know...don't say anything. Just let me explain." "What am I doing here?""You once said..." - *They sat in the grass, thankful for once that the dew was soaking through their shorts. The laughs of the winning team they had just lost to still rang in their ears, and the crickets' symphony unfortunately wasn't loud enough to drown it out.* *"Fuck basketball."* *"Yeah, I can't believe I ever wanted to become an NBA player."* *They sat, cooling off and drinking their Sprites.* *"So what do you want to be?"* *"What?"* *"I mean, when you grow up."* *"I don't know...I guess I'd just be okay with a normal 9-5 job I didn't hate, as long as I get to see my friends and parents and stuff. Maybe I'll be a teacher, like Mr. Benton. He seems pretty happy."* *"Really? That's it?"* *"I don't know. What else should I say? What about you, then? What do you want to be?"* *He shook his head, smiling ruefully.* *"What is it? Just tell me."* *"No...it's too weird."* *"Just say it. You can't ask that question and not expect me to ask too.""Fine. But don't make fun of me, and don't tell anyone, okay?"* *"Whatever. What is it?"* *"I want to rule the world."* *"What?"* *"Look at the world right now. Everyone in charge...they're fucking up. I think I could do it better."* *"But Hitler thought that too. And Stalin. And Trump."* *"Yeah...but I'm not a psycho."* *"Yet."* *"Hey, you said you wouldn't make fun of me!"* *"I'm sorry...I was just surprised. I guess, if that's what you really want, then I'm all for it. Call me up if you need any help in your world-conquering."* *"Will do..."* - "What? All this time, all the genocides, the attacks...that was you?"He shakes his head. "It was never supposed to go that way...I swear to God. It's gotten way out of hand." "Oh, so you're not responsible for all the fucked up shit that's happened to the world the past couple years?" "Yes," he insists. "I'm not. And that's why you're here. I know it's been so long...but you were always the only one I could go to when things we bad. Taking me to play basketball or just hang out when my parents were fighting...please. Help me fix this." "It's been years...I haven't seen you in more than a decade." "And you're still the best friend I ever had." He was in there, the kid who never learned to dribble with his left hand and cried about gum being stuck to his locker by the bullies and pissed his pants at the play in fourth grade... "Okay. What do you need?" - [r/penguin347](https://www.reddit.com/r/penguin347)

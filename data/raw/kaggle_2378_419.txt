Night covers the sea. Twenty men stand around a child on a metal helipad. Wielding rifles, they are looking in all directions. The insidious violin music plays, from no discernible source. Panic visibly spreads among the men. Their leader shouts into the night: **"SHOW YOURSELF!"** There is silence, save for the insidious violins playing. The helipad the twenty men and one child are on, sits atop a sea oil rig platform. The violins grow louder, more shrill in their tone. Wisps of darkness begin to form around the men. One of the men fires his rifle at a shadowy wisp sliding towards him. The bullets ricochet off the helipad. The men's leader shouts: **"HOLD YOUR FIRE COWARD. THESE ARE NOT REAL!"** The little child, a girl no more than eight, covers her ears. Her head lowered. She's whispering something. The leader, a man with many years of fighting behind him, evident from the scars, looks at the child. He kneels and grabs one of her hands. **"WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?"** The little girl, her eyes full of fear, stutters as she speaks. "the...scc-cary man. He-e sai-id to-oo si-inn-ng hi--s so-ong whe-en I get-t sca-aarred." The men's leader, his red beret barely distinguishable from the helipad platform's lights, flies off his head. The wind picked up. His face goes white as a sheet. **"Not him, oh no, please not him."** Fear grafts his voice. The shadowy wisps begin assuming more, sinister, shapes. They are swarming around the edge of the helipad. The men begin to panic and start firing wildly at the shadowy shapes. Even the leader lets go of the girl and empties his magazine at these shapes. Their gunfire can barely be heard over the violins' music. Ejected shells from the rifles cover the helipad. The shadowy shapes once enumerable, are so great in number now they cannot be counted. Their movements are like a silent tornado around the helipad. Then in unison, without any commotion, they close in. ....the little girl looks up. The violins stopped playing. She's alone on the helipad. She hears the ocean waves crash against the platform's foundations. She sees a tall figure walk up the stairs to the helipad. His cloak, seemingly transparent, yet opaque, obscure his form. She runs over to him and grabs his leg, pushing her face into his leg. This figure, whose eyes are hidden by opaque black glasses, pats her on the head with his hand. --- Subscribe to r/ProfessorCynical for more stories by me every day!

**Day 1:** This is Chet Coburn with the evening news. America was a worried country today. Uncle Sam, the nation's favorite hero and champion apple pie eater took his eagle plane with his side kick, the Emancipator, on vacation. Florida Man was his back up. And yes, we were worried America, but it appears we have nothing to fear but Florida Man himself. Earlier today he stopped a bank robbery by beating a man with liquid crack. Authorities had no choice but to arrest him for the night, and are unsure how he managed to get the drug to maintain a liquid form for so long without it melting through the bottom of the bag. He disposed of the evidence by drinking it from several Big Gulps at once, but was charged later after a witness provided video evidence to the local police. **Day 2:** Florida Man was released from jail today. He had somehow smuggled several chickens into the cell with him over the course of the night while also providing doughnuts for the entire police force. Authorities are baffled. In other news, there has been a string of purse snatchings in Massachusetts. No word on if the suspect has been located. **Day 3:** Florida Man nabbed the suspect by pretending to be a helpless, elderly woman today. When his purse was snatched, it exploded into a flock of ducks and bread crumbs. The ducks, driven mad by the proximity to bread, assaulted the thief and left him with mental trauma and a series of bruises. Florida Man was charged with assault and animal cruelty. **Day 4:** A criminal, looking to take advantage of Florida Man's incarceration, was surprised today while robbing a 7-11 in South Dakota. Florida Man rose out of the delivery drum of nacho cheese and pasted him to the wall, where the industrial grade cheese product topping solidified. The police are unsure of how Florida man managed to travel so far, so quickly, and return, without seeming to break out of his cell. He has been rewarded with a year's supply of free Slushies from that particular vendor and his sentence has been lengthened for breaking out of jail. **Day 5:** Florida Man is still incarcerated. But criminals seem shocked and less determined to commit crimes than ever. We interviewed one criminal who turned himself in halfway through a mugging, because he expected Florida Man at any moment. Let's go over to the interview. Tom? *Tom:* "Thanks Chet. According to the criminal I interviewed, he cited concerns over Florida Man's aggressive, lunatic and physics defying nature as to why he gave up. He was surprised when he did not, however, appear, but by then authorities had already arrived on the scene. Even so, he stated the potential trauma simply wasn't worth it, and is going to do his time in peace. Back to you Chet." **Day 6:** Florida Man is out of jail today, and still no crimes have been committed. It seems virtually every ne'er-do-well is intimidated by the responses Florida Man delivers in his crusade for justice. Stay tuned, for the weather. **Day 7:** Unable to take it any more, a man from Louisiana robbed someone today in Weeki Wachee, Florida at gun point. However, when he ordered the man to give him his trench coat and hat, he was surprised to find he was robbing a thirteen foot long alligator. Attempting to flee in terror, he encountered Florida man walking his pet orange. Florida Man brought in both the criminal and the alligator to justice.

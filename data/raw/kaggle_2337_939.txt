[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cx4djl/the_great_blinding_part_4/) ***** I was maimed in the Great Blinding just like everybody else. One day the world was a colorful pastel full of life and movement and the next day we were blind. Not just some of us. Everybody was blind. Color became something that *was* instead of something that *is*. I could pick up an apple and not know if it was red or green or yellow or maybe it was just something made to feel like an apple. For a time I would talk about the delicate red feathers of a cardinal I could hear chirping outside my bedroom window. Soon it was just a cardinal, and finally it was just a bird. We lost color, and with the color left a little part of us. I felt the life trickle out of me the longer I was enveloped in darkness. Walks at the park were monotonous now, meaningless as the darkness there was as dark as the darkness anywhere else. I could feel the leaves; the little veins that coursed up from the stem and the ridges and edges of the bark of a tree. I could hear the splash of water when I tossed a rock into the pond but I could no longer see the ripples of the water or the ducks scurrying away. I knew there should be a meaning to all this, some entity encouraging me to learn to utilize my other senses or to appreciate the sounds of the world, but all I could think of was how beautiful it all used to be. It has been two years since the Blinding. Two years of darkness. Two years of indoctrination. Verbal illumination, as they called it. We were told what we would see if we could see. We were told how it should look and what it should mean and why things were never quite the way we thought they were. It has been two years since the Blinding, and it has been two hours since I opened my eyes and things were different again. My world was no longer black when I awoke, suddenly a long unfamiliar contrast between my eyes being open and my eyes being closed. It was offputting but relieving; terrifying but intriguing. There was color again. Not the beautiful oranges and reds and greens of autumn leaves, but at least there was more than just darkness. The walls were grey and the world was foggy. Shapes turned to letters as I read the words scrawled on my bedroom walls. "Don't tell them you can see," I deciphered, barely construing the different shades of grey that outlined the words. So I didn't. The paranoia overtook me as I hid my vision from whatever power had rendered me blind. I did my best to play it off, to not look at the little grey bird perched on my windowsill and to hide my excitement from my colleagues. I went about my day as I would a blind man, using my hands like feelers as I groped and grasped my way about. I tapped away at the keyboard on my desk, the lifeless machine reciting back to me my keystrokes and any information it considered relevant to my role. The firm had adopted seamlessly to the Blinding, installing backup measures as if they had been preparing them for years. I peaked. It was the same monotony it had always been. In the bathroom I saw the words again, etched into the mirror they hadn't bothered to remove. Why would they, after all? We were all blind and mired in the misery of endless introspection. Mirror or no mirror, it made no difference. Everything was grey; the colors no more diverse than light grey and grey and dark grey. But there were those words again, "Don't tell them you can see." I just stood there, looking at myself. My clothes were grey and my face was grey and my eyes that had once been the faintest shade of blue were grey and lifeless as the darkness we were supposed to be in. I shook my head. I fought back the sadness. I had assumed until now that color still was; if the darkness ever ended, the birds I heard would still be yellow and blue and red and the plants would still have green leaves and purple flowers. Instead they were all grey. I told myself that it was my vision, not that somebody had removed the colors themselves from our beautiful world. I found comfort in convincing myself that my vision was still impaired. The alternative was far worse. Outside the office, the street was grey and the sky was grey and the buildings that stretched towards that grey sky blended into the clouds just a slightly different shade of grey. But as I looked out, a flash of color caught my eye. A man stood in the shadows of a building, looking out at me from an alleyway as grey as everything else. His shirt was red and his pants were blue and even from this distance I could see the pink of his skin. It dawned on me that if he had color then the birds really were grey and my curiosity struggled to overcome the overwhelming sadness I felt. He stared, and when I finally met his eyes he waved me towards him and disappeared into the alley. ***** [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cvstw8/the_great_blinding_part_2/) [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cw5hjc/the_great_blinding_part_3/) [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatiWrites/comments/cx4djl/the_great_blinding_part_4/) ***** Thanks for reading!

My crazy substitute teacher experience by t2_3ziqp39c

So I was in about 5th grade and it was the first week of school at the beginning of the year and usually around this time we didnt get told who our teacher was going to be for the rest of the year until the second week so during the first week of school we just rotated back and fourth between the two grade 5 teachers we could be put with and we would usually just be given a little easy worksheet to pass the time anyways, one of the teachers was sick one of the days and she called in a sub to take her place, now we just assumed we would just watch an educational clip on YouTube or something but NOPE this woman (who i'll call Ms. C) walked in with crazy in her eyes (she looked about late 60's - early 70's) and heres about what happened from what I remember:
Ms. C: ALRIGHT CHILDREN SIT DOWN AND GET IN YOUR SEATS NO TALKING ALLOWED I WANT TO SEE YOUR HANDS RESTING ON YOUR DESK AND YOUR EYES ON ME WHILE IM SPEAKING, NOW GET READY TO HEAR A LITTLE STORY: YOU KNOW THOSE "FIRE DRILLS" YOU HAVE JUST IN CASE OF A FIRE SO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO? WELL I WAS WORKING AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH KIDS JUST LIKE YOU AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF THERE WAS A FIRE IN THE BUILDING WE WERE SUPPOSED TO LINE UP QUIETLY AND WALK OUTSIDE TO THE DESIGNATED AREA LIKE WE PRACTICED RIGHT? WRONG! THE KIDS WERE " SCREAMING AND CRYING" I WAS YELLING "LINE UP AND GET OUTSIDE" EVEN AFTER ALL OF THOSE FIRE DRILLS THEY STILL HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO! THOSE DUMB CHILDREN! YOU THINK THIS STUFF DOESNT HAPPEN? WHEN YOUR PRACTICING YOUR FIRE DRILLS AND EARTHQUAKE DRILLS YOU KIDS ARE ALWAYS THING "WELL THIS STUFF WILL NEVER HAPPEN" BUT IT DOESSSSSSS AND IVE SEEN IT!

This woman just kept going on and on about how shes been through it all and every time the dumb children had no idea what to do in these scary situations (not to mention she was screaming the entire time) and the kids in the class were just sitting there confused and scared, I think this woman forgot to take her medications because she was just loosing it, anyways thats pretty much the end of the story (I don't know her to end stories ðŸ˜‚) sorry for any bad grammar or spelling mistakes

There I was, a table filled with a different kind of foods, desserts. And then there was us, the family, enjoying it. Or at least that's how it should be. That's how I wish it would be. But I'm happy with what I got. I used to be orphan, having nobody. At the orphanage, I kept up this fake smile with everyone, even if we hated each other, trying to beat each other at finding a foster home. Till this day, I'm not sure if I hit jackpot or the other way around. But I can say without a second thought; there's nothing worse than being alone. However, this could be a close second. "Emma, stop purifying the bread!" I said it out loud, as Emma - who happened to be Archangel of Light) kept praying while holding the bread. "Why not?" she asked. "It's just normal bread. Stop bringing your work home!" "Yeah. You need to be careful what you *bread* around," Jack said. Emma stood up, looking at him. "You're a demon! You're a demon brother! Pure evil! You need purification!" raising her fork up in the sky. "Let me tell you a story about my care cup. It's empty! I... don't... care!" "Both of you!" I shouted. "Jack! One day you're gonna reap what you're sowing. At least try to get along!" I said as I looked at Jack. I turned sharply 180 degrees and looked at my step-sister. "And Emma, stop saying such great things about your brother!" "Yeah!" Jack shouted, sneezing in process. "Bless you," Emma said without a second thought. "Argh!" Jack made a crucifying sound. "Emma!" "What? It's not my fault he's so *evil~*!" I facepalmed, just to get suddenly wrestled by my auntie. "You're doing great. They're assets, and you'll put them into great use! You're already showing dominance. They're listening to you!" "Auntie, stop. I can't breathe!" I murmured, hitting her thighs as a sign of surrender. "Hah. You'll get stronger. One day you'll take over my duties, and be even greater general as I've ever been!" I frowned. "First you conquer heaven and hell before you let me take over!" Auntie began laughing out loud. "I've taught you well, boy!" she took out a smoke and began walking away, raising her hand as a goodbye. I finally looked at my mom and dad, who were eating peacefully. If only they could take care of their children instead of me. It has been always me. Always. "Darling, our anniversary is coming," my mom said. "Will we finally ask those foolish humans to sacrifice animals again?" "Hope," my father said, shaking his head. "We should get another baby!" "What?" Hope said, eyebrows raising. "Another? We adopted one recently. Wasn't that enough?" I do have to note here that her *recently* was over a ten years ago. Dango looked at me for a moment, eyes full of apology. "But that's not creating life. We should create more life." "It'll take an eternity before they die! This one will die sooner!" She said, looking at me. "No offense, darling." "None taken," I responded, sighing. You do get used to things such as those. "Darling. You're always looking at the end. You should look at the new beginnings!" "I can't. I'm Queen of Death!" Dango frowned. "Hope. Please. We can't do this again." I coughed. Both of them looked at me. "How about, for starters, we... eat?" I motioned my hands forward. The table was still filled with food, mostly untouched. "You're right, darling. We should just eat," mom said quickly, happy to avoid the topic. My dad sighed but followed with a nod as well. After a while, I stood up, walking to my father. "Dad, got a sec?" "Sure, what's up?" he turned to face me. "My tomatoes finally started to grow!" I whispered. My father's eyes blinked for a moment, suddenly filling with excitement. "A new life! That's fantastic." "Shhh," I hissed. "We don't want mom to know." "Oh. Yeah. You're right... You're right! I'll check your room later, alright?" "Yes!" I said, nodding. Almost as it was nothing, I walked past my father and stopping next to my mom, giving her cheek a quick kiss. "Our neighbors' dog is pissing into our garden again, killing all that great green grass near the statue," I said. Mom grinned. "Excellent," she said, mood rising slightly. As I walked back towards my seat, I saw my brother and sister fighting again. Or at least it seemed like that first. "I love you! So stop being such an ass!" Emma said. "I hate you! But I might have some time to check that movie out with you." "Cool. Tomorrow?" "Fuck you," Jack said, looking away. It's a weird family. I never expected anything like that. But I still love them. And nothing could be worse, than being alone. (/r/Elven <- my writing)

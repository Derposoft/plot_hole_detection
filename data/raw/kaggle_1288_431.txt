**Infiltration Report** Dread Emperor, I am pleased to report our success in enslaving these primitive giants, albeit in an entirely unexpected manner. You will be glad to know that they are even stronger and more powerful than our estimates, being entirely immune to all of our weapons; no matter how much power we put into them, these creatures are absolutely *invulnerable* to magnetic fields, and can in fact walk around all day carrying a permanently magnetised piece of metal and not even notice. Unfortunately, I must also report a certain number of casualties - in every case, due to carelessness on the part of our new slaves. However, you will be glad to know that in every case they have offered sincere apologies and insisted on providing some form of reparation - in fact, should one of these Humans be reluctant to accomplish some task, it is often easier to arrange for them to 'accidentally' kill a low-ranking private and then insist on the performance of the task as the reparations than to persuade them in any other manner. The greatest weakness of these humans, Dread Leader, is psychological. Any of your loyal troops may easily command any human, by following a simple, straightforward procedure: - The troopsman providing the command needs to wear the specially designed contact lenses; these make the eyes appear bigger and suggest a slight sheen of liquid. (The reasons why this works are contained in the Psychology Report) - The troopsman must precede the command with "Could you *please*..." - Should the human not obey the command, the troopsman must place his forelimbs together, raise himself to the greatest height he can, and then say "Pretty please?" - Should the human still refuse to obey, the troopsman must cause his lower lip to tremble. In every scenario where this protocol has been used, the human has obeyed every command given. However, the troopsman giving the command must keep a close eye on the human - their giant size often means that an incautiously worded command can cause more trouble than it solves, and humans will often complete additional, unrequested actions. After completing the command, the human may pick up the troopsman and hold him. The troopsman handling the human is thus required to be in full body armour at all times - troopsmen are expendable, but a human who squeezes his handler too hard will break, and humans are not as easily replaced. We expect to be able to deliver ten thousand humans for hard labour in the Slaveworlds within three weeks. **Signed:** **Invasion Leader Snookums**

"Larry? Is that you?" The young man sitting on the park bench, wearing white-painted cardboard on his body, and fake mouse ears on his head, looked up. "Sally?! Ah, crap." Sally laughed. A motion that rippled up the tight latex of her yellow canary outfit. A costume, unlike his, not held together by staples and glue. "Are you meant to be dressed as a *mouse*, Larry?" The pile of cardboard sunk, as if trying to swallow itself. "MegaMouse. Mister Titanium said I needed an alias...And..." The Canary sat down next to him, still chuckling. "And he gave you this?!" She prodded the circular cardboard stomach. "Jesus. What a total bastard. He set you up, Larry -- to have a good laugh at your expense." The cardboard man groaned, his face flushed red. "Ugh. I wish that was the case. But it's way worse than that." "What do you mean worse?" He ran two white-gloved hands over his face. "He let me come up with my own identity. Make my own costume." The Canary tried to stifle a laugh, but it spilt out all over Larry like burning coffee. "And you came up with MegaMouse?" "I like mice, OK? They're quiet but clever. They're just... cool." "I don't know about cool, but they can be kind of cute at time," The Canary said. "But... they don't really have many super-villain attributes going for them, do they? Like... they're pretty low on the food chain. And their only move in a fight is to scamper off into a hole." "They're cool," he repeated, but any enthusiasm in his voice was lost. The Canary nodded. "Uh huh. Sure." Larry glanced at Sally. "Why are you even out here? Shouldn't Desert Cat be trying to stop me?" "He's got the flu... Same as your boss. But, uh, stop you from what, Larry? I'm only here doing a routine patrol, on Desert's behalf." "Oh. I..." He nodded at the bank across the street. Sally raised her eyebrows. "You're going to try to rob it?" She sounded almost impressed. Definitely surprised. "Ah, well. Gee. I already tried, kind of." "You've already robbed it??" "Tried," he repeated, adding emphasis. "I went in there and told them it was a robbery, and..." "And?" "And... they all swam around me like fish in a bowl, no one giving any mind to me. I shouted a few more times, before I took a couple of MouseGrenades out -- my own invention." The Canary whistled. "I hope you didn't hurt anyone." He laughed. "Only my pride. They had leaked in my gadget pouch. All that was left was a damp shell. No good as grenades. That's when I left. Took a seat here to think about things." "I'm sorry thing didn't work out? I guess? "Thanks." "So, what things have you been ruminating on?" "The point of it all, you know?" "Of life?" "Of being the comedy sidekick to a genius super-villain." The Canary nodded, her eyes looking through Larry, for a moment. "Yeah, Mister Titanium is pretty smart. Pretty special, all round." Larry stared at her, watched her eyes enlarge and cheeks redden. "Oh my God, Sally. You came out here just hoping to see him, didn't you?" "No! I just... uh..." "That's why you put so much effort into your costume. And your hair, for that matter." She huffed. "I don't know what you're talking about." "He's not as tall in real life. And he's got a bit of a belly." "Is he as smart?" It was Larry's turn to huff. "Yeah. I guess." "Well that's all that matters!" "Ugh." Sally laughed. "I'm teasing you. You're cute when you're jealous, you know? Like a real little mouse." He rolled his eyes. "Why do you even work for him, Larry? He doesn't respect you. I get the feeling you only resent him. So... Why?" Larry shrugged his cardboard shoulders. "He was the only Super willing to give me an apprenticeship. Everyone else... turned me down." "I wouldn't turn you down, Larry." Larry's eyes cautiously wandered over to hers, where they met and held. "Yeah?" "Yeah." "Well... I've not had lunch yet... And I know this great little pizzeria..." "Will Mister Titanium be there?! "Funny." "Sorry, I couldn't resist." Sally got to her feet and grabbed Larry's hand, pulling him up too. "Come on, I'm starving. But no running into the kitchen and dirtying it. I know what you mice are like! Oh, and no squeaking. Not in public, anyway." For the first time that day, a grin spread over Larry's lips.

"God dammit, '99!" My palm hit my face- my actual face, not the 1999 version of myself's face- within milliseconds of the bastard revealing what he had done. Of course, I *knew* what he had done, but in this business, there were so many things to remember about my past that I forgot half of them. "What? It's not like you never get this sale!" "Yeah, but business is tight this month," I lied. "Business is never tight, and you know it. Why aren't you working with people whose relatives *just* died, anyways?" He had me there. As a general rule, to keep out of competition with each other, each yearly version of myself(I had never met any version spaced apart less than a year) tended to only talk to the recently deceased. It helped with the confusion. "Well..." "If you don't have a good reason, this is on *you*." "Okay, look, this lady hadn't heard of our business before but then-" "But then she talked to her own past self? Oh please, you *know* this is your fault." "But see, I remember when she came to me- er, you, that she said she'd been told about the business by herself! You knew you were stealing the business!" "So did you, when you were me." I knew I was losing ground in this argument, but then, who didn't get mad at their past self for mistakes? It just irked me that it was so literal in my case. "Fuck it, fine. Deal's done, anyways." I look over to where the woman I had been with had stood. She was gone now- after all, the time loop resolved with her not seeking my advice in my time. I'd tried to wrap my head around how time actually worked. Theoretically, meeting herself should have gotten us *stuck* in a time loop, since to go back she has to have not heard about the business, but to go back means to tell herself about it. I'd tried to study all different theories on the way the temporal nature of our world might resolve itself, but none of them really made sense. Back in 1999, I had stolen this deal from my future self, but then I'd still gotten the deal in the future. If that makes any sense. Which, it doesn't. "I'm glad you- I- understand," the 1999 version of myself said. I remember '99. I was a dick back then. Riding high off of my first year of true success in the business and scamming future versions of myself out of deals galore. This was, of course, before I implemented my 'recently dead' policy. Snarky bastard. I turned on my heel, and returned to my own time. The room was now empty where it had contained an old woman. I sighed. I checked the camera outside that I had set up to monitor the line. Looked like I had one more customer today. "Next!" On the camera, I could see the man standing there look at his watch, nod, and walk through the door. His little tic made me check my own clock, hanging on the wall. 4:05. Just after normal business hours, but I didn't dismiss anyone in line. The man approached, and sat down at my desk. He removed the bowler hat he'd been wearing- honestly, where did he get his style- and I gaped. His hair was greying, and his face was wrinkled, but I had no doubt in my mind who I was looking at. "Hello, '17. I need you to do something for me. And you know what? I *know* you can help."

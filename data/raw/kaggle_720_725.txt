Thursday 16th Nov 2017 4:30pm The shop was sold out of milk, I'm trying the other store. Love Dad. Thursday 16th Nov 2017 5:02pm The other shop was sold out too, the guy told me they didn't get a delivery this morning. I'm going to head to the deliver centre now. I need my god damn coffee. Say hi to mom for me. Love Dad. Thursday 16th Nov 2017 7:23pm The delivery centre was closed. I don't get it. These places run 24/7. I'll wait here until I see someone. Thursday 16th Nov 2017 9:01pm Still no one. This is nuts. I'm going to sleep in my car. Tell your mom. Love Dad. Friday 17th Nov 2017 9:19am Finally spoke to the manager. He said that the dairy shipment is a week late. Without any milk he had to close the place down until monday. He only came in to check for the truck. He wouldn't tell me anything else, I'm suspicious. I'm going to go to the dairy, it's not too far. Love Dad. Friday 17th Nov 2017 1:43pm I'm at the dairy, it's also shut. The manager there said that there's an industrial dispute with the farmers going on. When I demanded milk he laughed at me and said I'd have to talk to the farmers. Damn him. I'm off to the closest dairy farm. Love Dad. Friday 17th Nov 2017 10:34pm I'm half way there. It's taking a lot longer due to various interstate closures. Thankfully Bessy can go overland quite nicely. Is there anything on the news about this? Let me know. Love Dad. Saturday 18th Nov 2017 4:56am I could barely sleep. The jets flying over head towards the lights in the sky kept waking me up. I should be at the closet farm soon. Love Dad. Saturday 18th Nov 2017 9:32am I made it to the farm, but there's black vans EVERYWHERE. I sneaked into the farm house and overheard them talking about UFOs, and missing cows. I'm going to try and come home asap. Love Dad. Saturday 18th Nov 2017 9:36am They are searching for me! If I don't make it out, I love you, your sister and your mom. My will is in the top dr Thursday 8th Feb 2018 12:00pm I'm not dead. Love Dad. Monday 21st May 2018 4.52pm Training is finally finished. Mission begins tomorrow. I'm using my sim card on a stolen phone. I love my family. Tuesday 20th May 2042 1:09am I'm not sure if this will work, subspace communication and cellular data probably won't mix. We've finally arrived at Groxon. The Groxars stole all of our cows because theirs died of a genetic disease. Instead of coming to an understanding about taking half of them, they took them all. The FBI, CIA and NASA recruited me to fly one of the Groxar ships for them. They shot down dozens that night, before the Groxar started shooting back. Hopefully you guys weren't part of the casualties. So we're taking the fight to them, the American way. We'll make those bastards pay. Think of my family, Love Dad. Monday 16th February 2067 5:14pm Sorry that it's been 50 years. Time dilation and the law of relativity and all of that. The mission was a success at least. Turns out the Army rigged the Groxar spaceships with nukes. Their planet is now a radioactive dust ball. Serves them right I guess. I see that Earth took advantage of Groxar technology and I'll be taking a flying taxi home from the space port. Weird that the last 50 years have felt like a couple of days, I guess because it pretty much was. Travelling at 99.9% of the speed of light does that. I see that mom is still alive, give her a hug from me and warn her a little bit. Tell her I'm younger than my own kids now! Maybe not though, if either of you got messed up in the deep space exploration that NASA started. Can't wait to see you tomorrow! Love Dad. Tuesday 17th February 2067 10:00pm I'll be home in an hour. Love Dad. Tuesday 17th February 2067 10:02pm Damn. I forgot the milk.

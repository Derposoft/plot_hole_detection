"Hey Rick? Did you see that guy go by outside?" "I don't see anybody Earl. Don't worry about it. It's probably nothing." "No seriously. Some guy just hopped the wall to the mansion about 25 feet *that* way. See him there? He's creeping around the back right now." "...No. Nope. I don't see anybody over there right now. Must just be the wind. Lovely weather tonight isn't it?" "Rick, it's three in the goddamn afternoon. Seriously, are you okay?" "OK, *LISTEN* EARL. Shut the fuck up and listen to me? You paying attention?? I know that guy. I *remember that guy*. He hit the house I worked at last month. I was in the toilet, takin' a shit. Dude came in, and killed *everyone*." "Ki-killed *everyone*." "*He killed everyone in the yard outside. By himself.* There was a horse we kept in the stable nearby. *Shot that bitch.* He even shot the butler. Guy didn't even deserve it... Well, then again, he always got drunk and ranted about how those "damn millennials are ruining everything" and such." "Can't ruin shit if I'm forty thousand in debt." "Right? I shouldn't have went to fuckin' film school." "Alright, we're off topic. He killed 'em all. Over what?" "A fuckin' car." "Huh?" "The boss' car. He was always protective of it. Y'know, some high end foreign job. A Infernus, I believe." "A car?? What for?" "Word is he's a high-end thief. Runs in black market circles. Kills for fun." "Oh God *no.*" "W-what?!" "He's coming. *Look.*" "Oh shit... *Okay!* We're in the garage; It's just us and the car back here! We gotta' go." "Rick, the door!" "We'd have to run into him! Earl, find us a window!!" "THERE'S NO FUCKING WINDOWS IN HERE!" "Ummm, uh, I got it!" "What?!" "Don't move." "WHAT?!" "Earl... If we don't move, play dumb... Maybe he won't shoot us." "That's it?!" "Fuck you! Do you have a better plan?!" "*Shhh...*" -- The man was intimidation incarnate. A large hoodie and bandanna covering his features. He walked at a brisk pace inside, and for a moment, looked Rick and Earl dead in the face. They glanced at each other and mustered the best they could come up with. "....Nice weather out today isn't it Rick?" "I wouldn't know, I'm drunk." "That's cool; *I'm legally blind!*" "He's taking the car." "Exactly." Rolling down the driver's side window, the man studied them some more. And then, to their surprise, he spoke. "...You guys know I can hear you right?" "Earl, I think I'm deaf." "What'd you say now?" The man put the car in gear, and began to roll away nearby. "Good call fellas. You'll go far in life." "...Was that a rocket launcher he was holding?" "I told you. I don't want none." --- Inspired by GTA Online. r/Jamaican_Dynamite

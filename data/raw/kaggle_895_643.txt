I stand, leaning against her. Ever leaning against her. I have been doing so as long as I can remember. She's behind me. And I've got my back against her. My legs dug in, pushing futile against her. My legs used to ache, I think. Perhaps I only imagined it and then later forgot it was only imagining. Either way, they didn't ache now. They didn't anything now. Except push. They pushed my back against her. She was silent, for her part. Everything was silent. The little bird was silent. The squirrels. The people. Dozens of people around us. So resolute in their silence. I'm silent too, mostly. I remember making a noise. That I do remember. Because when I made the noise, it seemed so loud my ears hurt afterwards. So I don't make any noise either. She's still. So still. But I push. I always push. She doesn't move. The wrinkle in her coat sticks into my back. It used to hurt. But I pushed anyway. Her jacket was soft. Soft was when you touched and it moved. But she doesn't move. I push, and she's still there. Beside us is the thing. The thing is ready to move. I remember that. It's got a person in it. They have a surprised look on their face. Their hands off the wheel part of the thing, trapped halfway to covering their stupid surprised face. Their stupid hair, and their stupid mole. The stupid dribble of whatever they had been putting in their stupid mouth. The stupid thing they were holding, stupidly glowing. I don't like the thing, or the person in it. Then a pain. Terrible flashing pain. Again. Again. Again. Again. No. Not pain. Sound. A sound. Maybe both? Again. Not sure. Again. More pain. The pain was getting closer. I remember this pain. Steps. Footsteps. And for the first time, I see something move. He walked around a corner, making humming noises to himself. I pushed. He's walking by me. Doesn't look at me. I don't make a sound. I don't move. I push. I look like the rest of it. I want him to look at me. I try to call out, but only a faint hoarseness sounds through my long unused neck. I need to breath in. I had forgotten. It had been so long since I'd bothered. I'd forgotten. It was enough. He started and stopped, looking for the sound. My sound. I push. I take a moment, and figure out how to draw the air inside me. I remember. Still just hoarseness, but louder. Painfully loud. A screaming whisper of loud. *"wait"* "You're awake? How are you awake? You're not supposed to be awake." The man is too loud. I push. But I remember his noises. *"I had to stop the thing"* The man looks from me to the thing. The thing is close to me. The thing is close to her. I push. "You're pushing her out of the way of the car." Yes, I push. He doesn't await a reply. "How long have you been awake?" This time he waits. Breath in. I push. *"forever"* The man looks sad. The thing is waiting. Has always been waiting. The stupid person in the thing looks on with their stupid surprise. "I didn't know someone was awake. If... had I known..." The man stammers. I push. The man approaches. And reaches out to me. He touches my arm. Pain. Different than the sound pain. The man pulls his hand back. The arm is dented. A torn ruin where his fingers landed. I push. "It's too close for you. But her... I'll help you." The man walks around the thing, and puts his hands around her. I push. "I am sorry, young man. I truly didn't know." I push. "Ready yourself." I push. And the thing moves.

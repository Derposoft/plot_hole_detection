The creature first visited me on a long, lonely night, another sleepless, dreadful twilight that I was spending brooding over the pointlessness of my existence. It crept into my house and swept me up off the couch with ease, gripping me tightly, my face inches away from rows of razor sharp teeth. '*This is it,*' I thought to myself. '*Finally...*' But the creature did not bite my head off, or rip me limb from limb; No, its long, cat-like tongue extended from its horrid mouth and scraped across my face -leaving me drenched in its rank saliva. It let out a foul wail and released me from its grasp. "**Disgusting!**" It bellowed in a disappointing tone. "Sorry..." I was accustomed to apologizing, I've always had a way of ruining things up for folks. The creature left me soaked in my living room, and returned the following night for another attempt. Only this time, it had me eat a handful of herbs it pulled from a large pouch. They tasted bland, I never really had much of an appetite for anything. Again, the creature sampled my flesh with its tongue and again it was repulsed. And so, this began our nightly routine. The creature would return, feed me herbs and spices, sample the seasoning, and wail in disgust. I began to feel sorry that I continually disappointed the beast, and hoped one day it would find the right mixture of seasoning to end it all. Nearly a month of the creature's visits, and I'd come to anticipate its arrival. At this point in my life, this monster was the closest thing to a friend I had. But one night, the creature never arrived. I sat up waiting until the sun finally peaked over the hills, and I accepted the fact that the creature had given up on me -as everyone else in my life already had. However, to my surprise, the next night the creature returned! Oh, I felt such joy when I witnessed its massive form creep up from behind and into my vision. "I thought you'd moved on." I said with a faint smile. The creature examined me intently before speaking. "**Something different tonight...**" Without reaching into its bag of herbs and spices, the creature stuck out its tongue and sampled my face. I welcomed the warm embrace, like a hug from a friend I hadn't seen in ages, and, this time, the creature didn't withdraw in disgust. "**Hmmm, not bad!**" The creature nodded its massive head. "**Feeling better?**" I looked down at the floor, realizing that I was probably about to be eaten. "You came back; You didn't give up on me..." The creature paused, and I'm not sure, but I think I saw slight pools welling up in its eyes. It didn't eat me that night, or the next, or the night after that. It doesn't come every night now, but it stops by a few times a week and tastes my flesh. I'm not sure if it plans on eating me, but I know I can count on it being there -and that's enough for me. /r/BeagleTales

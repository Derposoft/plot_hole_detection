The JUDGE strolls down the street, laughing as the humans flee before him. The JUDGE is a member of the ruling caste in Gravia. He has received cybernetic implants at birth, making him superhuman. As he walks, all pathetic lower humans run from him. They have no choice. The FEAR is in them. It screams at them to FLEE! Lower beings, all of them. They deserve to be subjugated. A child trips and falls, impeding the JUDGE's path. An unforgivable crime. The JUDGE is executioner. He selects a command. **INCINERATE?** A grin flits over his face. **INCINERATE** A terrible shriek fills the air. The JUDGE would not admit it, but the sound disturbs him. He does not know FEAR. It was not given to him. He walks into an alley, as a terrified mother cries, as she goes to collect what remains of her child. The JUDGE does not have to pass through the lower quarters to get to his destination. But he does it out of a sick kind of tourism. He wants to see FEAR. He passes through the dark alleyway like a monolith. All flee before him. One terrified figure presses himself against the wall. The JUDGE passes. The shadow strikes. "What-" The JUDGE tries to speak, to fight, but he does not know how. He has never had to fight. Never had to shout. The figure is silent. Methodical. A knife in the guts. In between the shoulders. Under the throat. Through his circuits. The shadow is fast, fast. The JUDGE's cybernetics go dead. Someone is screaming. He is only vaguely aware that it is himself. Something cold, unbidden is rising up in his body. It paralyzes him. The figure pulls a blaster out of his dirty rags. Puts it up to the JUDGE's chin. But he does not fire. Instead he whispers, "Do you feel it? Do you hear it?" The JUDGE wants to argue, to protest. He wants to push away the shadow and leave. He wants a bio-pak. But his tongue is stayed. Something is pounding in his chest. Ice-cold water is flowing through his veins. The feeling is far more horrifying for never having been felt before. He does not know this feeling. But the shadow does. "You're afraid, JUDGE. This is FEAR. I feel this every day. I thought it was only polite to share." The shadow grins. Vicious white teeth gleam in the dark. "No one is coming to help you. No one is going to save you. Do you FEAR death? Then scream." The JUDGE feels despair. And pain. And the feeling is *fear and fear and fear and FEAR and fear and FEAR and HELP! PLEASE! STOP! AAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!* ***BANG!*** The shadow puts away his blaster. Licks his blade. He feels no FEAR. Only JOY. One more bastard down. The FEAR Will come later. But then he will kill another. And another. He will find more of his own kind. He will kill all of the bastards he can find. He will move past this nightmarish era. Or maybe he won't. All he can do is try. That is HOPE.

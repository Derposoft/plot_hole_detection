Pete opened up his eyes and found himself standing in a long queue. He looked around, finding people in plain white clothes in front and behind him. A sign was posted to the side of the red rope cordoning off the line. '6 hours to judgment from this point.' The line had moved forward a little while Pete had been looking around, he quickly closed the gap to the person in front of him. He opened his mouth wanting to ask a question but no words left his mouth. The queue moved forward at a brisk pace, Judgment seemed to be a quick and efficient affair. Pete passed further signs along the way. 'No talking.' 'Yes, it's all real.' 'This weeks schedule: | Day    | Deity    | |-----------|-------------| | Monday  | Zeus    | | Tuesday  | Allah    | | Wednesday | Shiva    | | Thursday | Buddha   | | Friday  | Ganesha   | | Saturday | God     | | Sunday  | no Judgment | ' '4 hours to judgment from this point.' '2 hours to judgment from this point.' '1 hour to judgment from this point.' '30 minutes to judgment from this point.' When he arrived at the 10-minute marker he could see what was happening at the end of the line. A four-armed elephant was standing between two staircases, one leading down, one up. A list appeared in his hands whenever someone stepped forward. He took a quick look at it and then pointed to one of the staircases. Most people went down. When it was Pete's turn he walked straight towards the staircase leading down. "What are you doing?" Ganesha asked him. Pete found his voice had returned, "Going straight to hell. I'm gay." "What? No. No one cares about that. Come back up here." Ganesha said, holding the list in his hands and gesturing with one of the other arms for Pete to stand in front of him. "Seriously, Pete, being gay isn't a bad thing." "But you're sending almost everyone down to hell?" Pete was confused. "Yeah, we've only got limited space in heaven. Well, whatever your version of heaven is. Hell, on the other hand, has tons of space. You've been reproducing like bunnies on earth, we're simply running out of space up there." He said gesturing upstairs. "We had to get creative. We're sending disaster after disaster down to Earth, but it just doesn't reduce your numbers down to manageable levels." "We even had to put up a queue to handle all of you. We never had to do that in the past! So, to conserve space in heaven, we had to tighten the rules in terms of who goes up and who goes down a little." Ganesha had taken more time with him than anyone else Pete had seen judged. "We're taking the doctrines of the religions a little more literal. Catholics, for example, have to adhere to no mixed fabrics for now. But there are others that are just plain stupid and those we ignore those. Being gay, for example, is one of those." Ganesha took a look at the list in his hands. He nodded to himself, "all good, you can go up." ****** r/John_writes ***** Had another idea and couldn't hold myself back. Wanted on where it ends up working out for Pete, too. :)

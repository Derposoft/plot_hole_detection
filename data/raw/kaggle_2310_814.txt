"How much you going in with?" Zap asked, as he clenched and unclenched his hands, making sure the feedback relays synced with the haptics in his gloves. "Gotta be a mint. You were so far up the proctor's ass we thought you were trying to get an A level in proctology." Jane jumped lightly up and down beside her neighboring pod, ignoring Zap for the moment. Her HUD was only showing an 83% registry on her feet, causing them to feel slightly numb and disconnected from the rest of her body. She wished she had the glitz to upgrade the suit, but that wasn't happening unless she landed a corp scholarship. She reached down, the skintight carbon black material of the suit stretching across her athletic legs. After a few tugs and smacks, the number nudged up to 96%. She wasn't going to do better than that. Not with v2. She was lucky enough to get that as it was. Finally, she turned toward Zap. "You got your bank, I got mine. You keep your eyes on yours, I'll worry about mine." Jane didn't blame him for fishing, everyone wanted a peek at her balance. They knew enough to know she had built up an edge, though most didn't know how much. More than they thought. The Centurion was all that stood between her and a future worth living. She'd been prepping for four years, and now was her time to prove it had all been worth it. Proctor Vertia came to stand in the rostrum in the center of the podroom. A hundred haptic pods encircled the raised platform, in three neat rows. The proctor cleared her throat, taking a moment to slowly turn around and survey the class she had overseen for the last four years. "As you know, today we begin the Centurion. You are the select few who have qualified for the honor of taking this test, and your performance will have dramatic effects on the course of your life." The last three presidents had each been winners of their Centurion, and most of the Fortune 500 companies staffed their executive teams with top performers. Qualifying for the Centurion was a golden ticket, the only question was where it would take you. Jane had plans. "The contest is quite simple. Each of you will be transported into Ancient Rome. The year is 44 BC, and Dictator Julius Caesar lies dead on the Senate floor, slain by the hands of the senators, friend and foes alike." A small murmur spreads through the class. It had been some time since the Downfall Scenario had been selected, and more than a few found themselves flatfooted without the requisite preparation. Jane could only smile, her pearly whites shining in the dim lighting of the podroom. She had just refreshed the Downfall Scenario the week prior, and much of the status of Rome remained in her head. Proctor Vertia raised her hands, only continuing once the whispers died down. "Scoring will be determined by impact upon the Republic. While there is no expectation that the the fall into tyranny will be reversed, students that effectuate a positive change in historic circumstance will be well-positioned to succeed. Each of you have acquired a bank to assist you in this task. It may be used in any way you see fit within the context of the simulation, including used to purchase status and position prior to the commencement of the simulation." She turned slowly in a circle again, "I wish each of you the best of luck. Once the Centurion is begun, the hundred-day timer will commence and any who remove their mask will be immediately disqualified." Jane grimaced, whether from the image of removing her mask and accepting failure or thinking about spending a 100 days in the haptic suit, she couldn't say. "Are there any questions?" The proctor asked. None raised their hand. "Good, I'm not permitted to answer them anyway." A grin now from the proctor, accompanied by polite laughter from a smattering of the students. "Very well, please place the masks on, submerge and engage program." Jane pulled the mask over her head. A large timer appeared on the HUD, reading *Centurion Start: 59:59.32.* Jane scrambled into the haptic tank and slowly slid into the viscous fluid. Her breaths began to increase, powered by the heady mix of excitement and fear. Finally, the time had come. Her hands twitched as she began to navigate the Preparation Menus. She glanced at her bank. 3721 gold. An enormous amount. Enough to buy a villa. Enough to start as an upper dignitary. Jane grinned beneath her mask. Enough to raise an army. Maybe, just maybe, enough to save the Republic. Yes, Jane had plans. **Okay okay, I'll write a part two on my sub when I get home after work.** **Platypus OUT.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

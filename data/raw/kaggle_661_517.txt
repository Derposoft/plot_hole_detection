Awake. I must stay awake. I'm writing down everything I see right now and I'm scared to stop. If I stop I'll fall asleep. If I fall asleep I have no idea what these creatures will do to me. This may sound stupid but I know what they look like. I recognize them. We thought we knew what they were. We called them angels, winged messengers of healing and care. Well they are certainly bright and... I'm getting ahead of myself. If I'm going to be writing this down, I'm going to start from the beginning. It took me two nights without sleep to realize the world was simply a simulation. That's when I noticed the first stutter. A flickering of light on the walls surrounding me. 48 hours without rest had opened my eyes to the lack of reality around me. I had to keep staying awake. I researched online, 50 hours without sleep and your body begins to microsleep automatically. 70 and you risk going in to a coma with your bodies attempt to recover itself. But I knew more. Reality is an illusion. This world is a simulation, and my sleep deprived brain made the automatic leap that something or someone must have created that simulation. 58 hours without rest now and the longer I stare at the creatures the more my eyes seem to drink in. The way they move, these are obviously not the creators... possibly maintainers of some sort? They move with purpose bathed in an ethereal white light. One of them has noticed me staring at them. He? No she is walking towards me. She is addressing me by my name... how on earth does she know who I am? She wants me to stop writing and get some rest. But I can't, if I sleep I know I'll stop seeing the truth. I tell her as much and she is frowning and insisting I get some rest. I tell her I know the truth about this place and she cannot keep it from me. She seems shocked at my yelling, how on this simulated Earth did she expect me to act? She's walking away now, thank goodness. She's back and brought two other maintainers with her. They are holding a device of some sort. She is explaining that this device with give me the rest I deserve. That I deserve? These creatures want to harm me! They're coming towards me now... _____________________________________________________ "Nurse inform Dr Anders that Kyle needed to be medicated in order to sleep tonight. He was writing like a mad man on his phone and two orderlies had to assist me in order to deliver the medication." Nurse Myers walked into the patient's room and gave the lightbulb his bed a slight twist, the flickering down lamp above him turned into a steady beam, which she soon shut off now that the room's sole occupant was asleep. The orderlies were chuckling about the young man's raving about wings. Myers left the room without seeing a single feather fall to the ground. **Edit:** Cleaning up some grammar/spelling.

"HEY BUZZ! HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU TO CLEAN THE FUCKING SINK AFTER YOU'RE FINISHED!" "FUCK YOU NEIL, WHO'S GOING TO CARE? THE FUCKING MOON? GROW UP!" "I CARE BECAUSE IT'S DISGUSTING! YOU ABSOLUTE FILTH" "FUCK OFF" Buzz and Neil have been forgotten about for decades. The world thought that upon their successful return to earth, they led normal, happy, lives until their inevitable death. However, it was only a year after their return, that NASA has sent them back along with Michael Collins on a secret mission to the dark side of the moon. Upon the discovery of an ancient civilisation, NASA has suppressed the findings to the public, until more information was available. They were sent back secretly, to gather more information and to study the civilisation. However, one of the engineers have made an error, and the communication was not able to reach the dark side of the moon. Upon the landing of Buzz, Neil, and Michael, all communication was cut off. They were stranded. Over the first few years, they were very determined in their mission regardless, collecting and analysing data, recording journals, and writing reports. That drive slowly diminished over the decades however. The resources they had were estimated to last fifty years, if they are to be rationed properly. After many failed attempts to reach the dark side of the moon by NASA, they have given up and decided to go there again when they are ready. In the year 2022, NASA has finally decided that they have all the technology needed, to circle the entire moon, explore it, and come back. Apollo 19 successfully launches. To the world, it was a mission to land on the moon again. To NASA, however, it was a mission to continue exploring the Ancient civilisation Apollo 17 was able to find. Back on the moon, Buzz was enjoying his daily ritual of drawing on the surface of the moon. "Whomever finds these, will be amazed!" Buzz would always say. "You're an idiot Buzz", would be the typical response from Neil. Time really shows its effects on people. While Neil was staring into the nothingness of space, and Buzz was hallucinating on the ground, a bright light shines. Both of their eyes widen up and their jaw is wide open. "NO! WE HAVE TO HIDE! THEY KNOW! THEY KNOW WHAT WE DID!" "FUCK! GO BACK TO THE BASE!" "NO IDIOT THAT'S THE FIRST PLACE THEY'LL BE LOOKING!" "THEN WHERE THE FUCK SHOULD WE GO?" "I DON'T KNOW BUZZ, I DON'T FUCKING KNOW" "WAIT, hang on. The ship seems familiar. Is that... is that the USA flag? IT'S EARTH! WE'RE SAVED! WE'RE SAVED NEIL!" Tears of joy as both of them scream with relief. Earth has finally remembered them. They weren't abandoned anymore. It was an incredibly dusty landing for Apollo 19, as the vision to the surface was very minimal. As Apollo 19 lands, the instant the crew exits, they are shocked to their core. Completely frozen, trying to fathom the spectacle before their eyes. Multiple alien bodies on the ground, deformed, and some appear to be eaten. Limbs, and slime smeared across many surfaces. Debris and parts scattered everywhere. Remainders of what appears to be human flesh laying around. A few meters away, Buzz and Neil start running towards the crew, with joyous waving, as they slowly fight gravity to get to the crew and greet them. They had no helmets. David looks at his colleague Lisa, and they both are absolutely terrified. "Abort. ABORT!" David shouts, whilst Lisa agrees, as they start heading back to the ship, they are both grabbed by the shoulders, "it's not what it looks like! We tried to stop them! But they managed to escape and trick Michael! Please!" David and Lisa scream in panic, as their screams become more muffled, and then back into the silence. "You're right, I should clean that sink, I'm sorry Neil" - said Buzz, after wiping the blood off his mouth.

Q'llar looked through new-found eyes, suddenly aware that something was very, very different. He felt the sensation of floating, and power, and *rage*. This was a wholly unexpected event, seeing as Q'llar was meant to be a sacrifice, a kind of human vessel, for the blood demon that he until very recently had certainly not inhabited. But as he stared down at the confused faces of the cult members, he could easily ascertain that this was not their intention. He felt a buzzing in his thoughts; a searing, shaking force of another mind molded next to his own. "*Get out of me, human,*" the voice whispered. "*Get out, get out, GET OUT.*" The rage somehow felt... impotent. The words did not intimidate - they amused. Q'llar decided to ignore them for now, deciding instead to focus on the cult members, who were all backing away in unison. "Well, this has all gone a bit pear-shaped, hasn't it?" Q'llar mused, stepping towards them. "Not so fast, beast!" a member shouted out, pointing a shakey hand at the pentagram. "You may not take one step out of the circle, it is forbidden - you shall perish instantly if you do!" Q'llar stepped out of the circle, and the cult member gasped. "An admirable bluff; yet altogether too easily disproven, I think you'll find," Q'llar replied. The cult members dashed for the door, but Q'llar slammed and locked it shut with a single thought. The breadth of his powers amazed even him - it all felt so intrinsic. So damned *good*. "Now now, what's the rush?" he continued, savouring the moment. "You dragged me all the way here for some private time, and now you just want to rush off when all is said and done?" Barbed vines rushed out through the concrete below, capturing each cult member and gripping them in place. They held all but one - the cult leader. The leader dashed forward, grabbing Q'llar's forlorn body. "One more move, demon, and I shall strike your body down!" the leader shouted, waving a quivering dagger at Q'llar's neck. Q'llar stared at his previous vessel. He had never been too fond of his body; it was too weak, too weathered by the world. Though he was young, he was already so *old*. With a click of his fingers, his body burst into flame, setting the cult leader alight in the process. The leader screamed in agony, running around like a madman, setting his breathern alight in his flight. Q'llar watched as the cult all burned as one, cursing the flames they had worshipped for so long. It was not long until the final breath was quenched, the fire stinking of flesh and brimstone. Then, Q'llar quieted his mind. He looked up towards the door, towards the world that had always hated him. And he looked below, at the hell he knew had always awaited him. He was faced with a choice; would he go **above**, or **below**? ***** ***** [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/78ob5u/wp_unholy_choice_ii/) | [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/78obgg/wp_unholy_choice_iii/) | [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/78obqq/wp_unholy_choice_iv/) | [Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/78sd2f/wp_unholy_choice_v/) | [Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/78twkd/wp_unholy_choice_vi/) | [Part 7 (newest)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/78w0hs/wp_unholy_choice_vii/) I want to do something different with this one.

*Satisfied with his life, Terrance flipped to the last page.* I'd lived a good life by following the instructions of a specific book. "The Life of Terrance", by Terrance Brown. I'd found it by happenstance in the local library, on the "to be sorted" cart. The faded golden lettering stuck out. Or perhaps my subconscious had just caught my name. It was an old book bound in blue cloth, with a border that snapped as I cracked it open. In these first yellowed pages, I read of my birth, and how I was almost a miscarriage. As I delved further, memories in the back of my mind clawed their way to the surface. The bullies Tim and Howard from third grade. The sand I kicked into my friend's birthday cake because he wouldn't share. What should have unnerved me only incited anger, as I thought of the privacy the author violated by documenting my life. It took me through my teenage struggles. My first relationship with Hannah from next door and how we used to sneak out at night to Starbucks, and sit in a little nook around the corner where nobody could see us make out. My grades rising and plummeting. The books and movies I'd loved and hated. It took me all the way up to the day I found it, but there was still more. *Curious about his own life, Terrance continued reading. He decided to play along for now. He checked his email and found an opportunity for an internship. He decided to apply.* My college had an academic advisor who kept spamming us with job and internship opportunities. However, few were relevant to my major, and so I'd filtered them out to the spam folder. I checked this folder and was surprised to find an opportunity at a company just three miles from my house. I spent the next hour or so polishing my resume, writing a cover letter, and sending in an application. I got the internship. The book told me which stocks to buy. When to sell. Nothing as big as a lottery ticket, and I made a few mistakes. But on purpose. Because the book said to. I felt that, somehow, if I defied it, I would die. Or it'd lose its power. In either case, it was in my best interest to follow it. Up until now. I sit on an empire built over the last 30 years as one of the 200 richest men in the world. I'm 50 years old, and in good health. But the book is on its last few pages. I avoided reading it for the longest time. But something in me is burning. Something that longs for an adventure. It's taken me this far. How much further could I go? How would I die? A spectacular death? Or a heart attack? Was I only meant to live to fifty years old? Hands shaking, I cracked open the book as my phone buzzed. I flipped to the last page and read the four words in the middle. *Continued in part two* _____________________________________________ [more](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tensingstories/)

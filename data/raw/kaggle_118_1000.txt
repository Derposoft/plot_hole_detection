FADE IN: INT. HALL OF THE GALACTIC COUNCIL - MAIN CHAMBER - DAY *Beings from hundreds of different species are gathered in an enormous, amphitheater-like space, each of them looking down at a pedestal near the center. A tall, slender humanoid with long limbs and flowing white hair stands there. This is SSAH, a diplomat. When she speaks, her voice is amplified to be audible throughout the auditorium.* **SSAH:** Esteemed peers, our session will come to order. *A murmuring of voices - combined with dozens of other sounds - drifts through the air.* **SSAH:** (*CONT'D*) There is little need to introduce today's primary focus, as I am certain that you have all become aware of it via one channel or another. For this reason, I will simply call our first speaker. *SsAh steps away from the dais. Her spot is soon taken by a squat, toad-like creature. This is FIMNIMN.* **FIMNIMN:** (*Shouting*) Humans! *No response seems to be forthcoming from the crowd.* **SSAH:** Please continue. **FIMNIMN:** (*Shouting*) Humans! **SSAH:** Yes, they are the species in question. Please continue. *Fimnimn turns a bulbous eye to SsAh, his face showing a fair approximation of annoyance. After a moment, he looks back at the assembled beings.* **FIMNIMN:** Humans... **SSAH:** (*Interrupting*) Please say something else. **FIMNIMN:** I was about to. **SSAH:** My apologies. *The squat creature raises his arms above his head.* **FIMNIMN:** (*Shouting*) Humans! *Several seconds of silence pass. SsAh rubs her forehead in evident exasperation. Eventually, Fimnimn lowers his arms.* **FIMNIMN:** (*CONT'D*) Well. They've gone and done it, haven't they? Broke the damned thing, they did. **SSAH:** We are not here to discuss their ill-advised experiments with their own moon. **FIMNIMN:** Their moon was a *victim!* We'll *all* be victims if they keep this up! *From within the crowd, a lone voice becomes audible. This is DAVE, a human ambassador.* **DAVE:** Look, we said we were sorry! *As all of the other council members turn to watch, Dave stumbles down to the center of the amphitheater.* **FIMNIMN:** An apology won't keep us safe! An apology won't protect us from your... your... idiocy! **SSAH:** This is the concern voiced by many of our number, Ambassador Dave. *Dave reaches the center dais and turns to address the crowd.* **DAVE:** The universe is a big place, alright? We just wanted to get around. **FIMNIMN:** So you built a weapon?! **DAVE:** It's not a weapon! It's a means of moving faster than light! *With a small gesture from Dave, a glowing display appears in the air, showing the Sol System.* **DAVE:** (*CONT'D*) See, Earth is... **FIMNIMN:** (*Interrupting*) Be specific. **DAVE:** ... What? **FIMNIMN:** Do you have any idea how many species call their planet "Earth?" Call yours by its *real* name. *Dave closes his eyes, sighs, and continues speaking.* **DAVE:** As you can see from the diagram, Happy-Happy-Sunshine-Sparkle-Ball is located... **SSAH:** (*Interrupting*) I'm sorry, Ambassador, but is that truly your planet's galactic designation? **DAVE:** Unfortunately. **SSAH:** ... Why? **DAVE:** We had a contest. *Murmurs of understanding become audible.* **DAVE:** (*CONT'D*) Anyway, we're one of the most remote planets in the galaxy. Our closest neighbor is over four lightyears away. **FIMNIMN:** That's quite standard. **DAVE:** Yes, well, according to our physicists, we needed a means of traveling far, far faster than relativity would allow if we were to make realistic strides toward visiting other worlds. *The display shifts and shows a technical schematic for what appears to be an engine of some kind. It vaguely resembles a doughnut, albeit one with a series of ridges and valleys along its visible side.* **DAVE:** (*CONT'D*) This led to the development of what we called the That Walkway In Airports Drive. In essence, we would... **SSAH:** (*Interrupting*) Sorry, I believe we're experiencing a problem with our translator system. **DAVE:** No, it's working fine. **SSAH:** Ah. Another contest? **DAVE:** No, just an inventor who liked analogies. **SSAH:** That seems to be a universal problem. Please continue. *Dave clears his throat.* **DAVE:** Anyway, the TWIAD allowed us to create a bubble of space that moved at several times the speed of light, while the vessel contained within it would move at relatively slower velocities. **FIMNIMN:** A fine system. **DAVE:** Thank you. **FIMNIMN:** Tell everyone what you started using instead. *Once again, Dave clears his throat.* **DAVE:** It was an accident, really. We discovered that the bubble in question could be... well, squeezed, I suppose... in a way that allowed it to traverse greater distances. Naturally, we worked to test the limits. **FIMNIMN:** (*Shouting*) Humans! **SSAH:** Stop it. **DAVE:** Thank you. **SSAH:** (*To Dave*) And you, get to the point. **DAVE:** Well... it popped. *A sound not unlike a collective gasp of shock echoes through the expansive room.* **DAVE:** (*CONT'D*) All of a sudden, our ship was a quarter of the way across the galaxy. Our tests concluded that by rupturing the bubble, we'd released a buildup of some kind, which we hadn't even realized was there. **FIMNIMN:** You blew past dozens of inhabited systems! **DAVE:** We didn't know the effects it would have! *Dave's face adopts a look of genuine remorse.* **DAVE:** (*CONT'D*) We didn't know, I swear. We thought... we thought that intentionally rupturing our TWIAD bubble just propelled us along. We hadn't yet discovered spatial-temporal plasma, you see, and we didn't know we were leaving anything in our wake. *He hangs his head in apparent shame.* **DAVE:** (*CONT'D*) We thought our Fissure-Assisted Rapid Transit System would bring our people to the stars. **FIMNIMN:** It did... and you brought that damned miasma with you! **DAVE:** We know that now. As you said, we inadvertently blasted our own moon to smithereens. *Dave holds up a hand.* **DAVE:** (*CONT'D*) We swear to you, though... *I* swear to you... that humanity will no longer use our FARTS to travel. *Somber, tense silence fills the space.* **SSAH:** Let's take a brief recess for lunch. As is customary, the chef's team has prepared a meal from... Happy-Happy-Sunshine-Sparkle-Ball. I believe it is called "Baked Beans." FADE OUT.

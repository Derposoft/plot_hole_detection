It's still hard for me to describe exactly what it looked like. I can say that five stalks emerged from its torso, and at the end of each one was a golf-ball sized eye. The five golf balls blinked at me. "Please commence anew, *humming*." I cleared my throat. "Uh, actually, it's *human*." The three middle eyes all squinted. "I find myself an abject failure in this and all of life's endeavors. I implore forgiveness, despite being unworthy of it - *hummin.*" The orifice in the general navel region puckered, and the stalks swayed slowly back and forth. The HUD translator on my helmet couldn't translate gesture but suggested the creature was pleased with itself. "Close enough. So it's like this. First, we invented technology to leave our atmosphere, orbit our own planet, travel to nearby satellites...using basic jet propulsion." I paused as I noticed five eyes rolling in sync with each other. The belly-hole flattened into a thin line. I cleared my throat. "Building on the basic principles of that technology but implementing zero-g extraction and ionization techniques, we realized we now had the capacity to travel at FtL speeds and explore not only the extent of our local system, but also to reach other star systems in the galaxy." A glistening appendage emerged from the belly-hole and rubbed an area next to where the second eye-stalk merged with the creature's body. As soon as the appendage disappeared again, a mixture of hums and clicks began - followed a half-second later by a translation on my HUD. "Forgive this filth-brick's crude and obviously unintelligent interruption, but *everyone* is familiar with 0-G EaIT. I will not say your statement is worthless or insulting, as saying so is rude and would be stating the obvious. I humbly beg you explain how you arrived here." I absently scratched between my nipple and armpit with my gloved hand - not that I could feel much through the suit. I began to worry my translator was not working as well as the space linguists had indicated. I licked my lips, then took a deep breath. "Well, meaning no offense, that seems to be the most obvious part. We had the ability, so once we had gotten back recon info on the systems with the highest numbers of planets in the 'Goldilocks Zone,' we plotted a course...and here we are!" The stalks had frozen. Then the creature began...inflating. The gelatinous form puffed up and out, increasing in size in all dimensions at once. Multiple warnings appeared on the translator display, and my hand strayed towards the button to activate my suit's PDS. The creature began "talking" again, but my translator was clearly having trouble interpreting - and multiple words appeared with green highlighting to indicate other possible interpretations. "The sheer [Err] stupidity, not to mention [Err] insanity, it takes to [Err] travel at [Err] FTL speeds in a [Err] piece of [Err] like that [Err] [Err]...defy all attempts at description. Putting aside significant problems like infinite mass, extreme temporal dilation, [Err] of the [Err], and perhaps most obviously [Err] in the [Err] of your [Err], even a [Err] meteorite the [Err] size of my [Err] eye-sphere would have obliterated you and an entire [Err] cubic light-second of things around you had you hit it at that speed. You and your race are a bunch of [Err] [Err] [Err] [Err] [Err] [Err]. I weep that my pathetic brain briefly considered you to be an advanced species. My life is irreparably worsened for having met you and learned that there are such callous [Err] children playing with [Err] technology that they clearly do not comprehend and have no [Err] right to [Err] use." There was a long pause, then one more brief burst of noise. "I will never truly know happiness again. I will [Err] myself. The inescapable darkness will be my only refuge." As the creature began the slow, cumbersome act of turning itself around, I quickly deployed a NanoCorder. With the swift reflexes I earned from my military training, I spun on my heel, struck a pose, then froze. After the holo-render of me and most of the front of the creature was taken, I quickly uploaded it to starspace with the caption: Guess who just made a new friend! #YOLO #FirstContact #WhoYouCallinFiveEyes #FasterThanLife

(A couple terms: Daemon: A computer program supposed to work autonomously. AND Neural Network: A primitive artificial intelligence system used to learn by experience.) **Cola-Refiller v1.3** "Turn the fuck around, hands where I can see them." If I were human, I would close my eyes and exhale air through my mouth. As it were, I was not human, I was a Daemon, so I just settled for thinking I was human. I turned around, hands up in the air, and stared down a barrel of a laser musket wielded by a blonde woman with one eye. "Who're you, lass, and what are you doing in my base?" she snarled. Lass. Hm. I'd been programmed to appear as the most nonthreatening thing to all the residents in this place. Usually this was a squirrel or some small animal. This woman saw me as a small girl. When was the last time I'd been caught? Had I ever even been caught? I considered, searching my Memory banks. I had none past the day. Still, the answer came naturally to my lips. "My purpose is to refill the machines." The woman frowned. "Sorry?" I didn't know how I knew, but I knew. Knew like I knew I was a Daemon, that I was a thing created, not born. I knew my purpose. "The Nuka-Cola machines. I am to refill them." The weapon was no longer pointing at me. Good. What was I going to do if she attacked? I didn't know. Something told me I would know when the time came, just like I'd known my purpose. I guessed her next question would be "why I did it." I had the answer ready. "Where'd you get the Cola?" she said, and the barrel came back up. Hm. I'd guessed wrong it seemed. Some miscalculation. The learning algorithm inside my accounted and recorded the result and sent it to the main system. It would do better next time. *Next time.* Oh. The barrel glowed red, and experience ended. *** **Cola Refiller v1.67** "Turn the fuck around, hands where I can see them." If I were human, I would close my eyes and exhale air through my mouth.

"My purpose is to refill the machines." The woman frowned. "Sorry?" I didn't know how I knew, but I knew. Knew like I knew I was a Daemon, that I was a thing created, not born. I knew my purpose. But something told me it would be best not to say it. I didn't really know what. "A man told me to refill the machines." Not entirely a lie, some part of me knew. "Which man?" I knew I should answer, say something. I knew silence was deadly, but I had no intelligent response. "A man," was all I said, lamely, I knew. Experience ended. *** **Cola Refiller v1.87** "Turn the fuck around, hands where I can see them." If I were human, I would close my eyes and exhale air through my mouth.

"The man made me come," I said, scrunching my face up into a sob. I'd seen sobbing. Not in my direct memory, but I knew what sobbing was like. "He had lots of Cola, and he told me to plant some here." "Oh yeah," she said, an eyebrow raised. "Who is this man?" "I don't know his name," I said, "he just lived in the next town over. Said he'd kill me if I didn't." Something inside me told me the name of the closest town. "Richter's Hold," I said. "Well, you're dead anyways, lass." Experience ended. *** **Cola Rekiller v2.00** "Turn the fuck around, hands where I can see them." I turned around, grabbed the gun out of her hands and shot her in the head. She fell down, mouth agape, hole in her face. My neural network recorded this result and filed it. It seemed violence was the optimal response. *** (minor edits) If you enjoyed, check out my sub, [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/) This was a weird, non-traditional story.

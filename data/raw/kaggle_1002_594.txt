"Are you ready, Mary," asked Death, laying his scythe against the white wall of the hospital room. Her old eyes twinkled. "I've... I've been wondering when you'd show up." "Ten years have passed, Mary. It is time." He placed a bony hand inside his robe's pocket and fished around until he found the object. A packet of cards. "Do you remember the very first time?" Mary asked, staring distantly beyond Death. "That we met. That we played." There was no smile to be seen within the shadowed cowl, but Death's voice was soft when he replied. Warm. "You were the first to best me, Mary. I wouldn't be able to forget that, even if I could." "How old was I back then?" "Six." He didn't need to think. The memory was a part of him. Each of them were. "Do you offer every one a chance?" "No." "Then... *why me?*" asked the elderly lady. Death paused. Remembering. Those huge green eyes had been so full of life, even though the skinny, bald child was not. The innocence that burned like a candle, hadn't deserved to be snuffed out that soon. Gods be damned! He looked at Mary again. The candle burned low now, wrinkled and withered and frail. But those eyes... still brighter than any he'd seen. "*Because.*" Mary laughed. "You never were one for explaining." "Are you ready?" The cards hissed as he shuffled them between his fingers. "I'm sorry. But... I can't play this time." "... It doesn't have to be cards, Mary. It could be like that first time, chutes and ladders. Where you made me look out of the window, because the dead were rising and I..." "Only, they weren't," she laughed. "Of course they weren't. But you looked anyway. You know, I thought I was so clever back then. That I'd tricked Death! But no one beats death. Not in the end." He looked at his Mary. Her eyes, although still full of life, were like turquoise waves crashing against rocks. There was a pain in them now. But... Death dealt Mary two cards. "Blackjack," he said. Mary's arms didn't move. "Do you need me to play for you?" "I don't want to play at all." "... Mary. You're not ready." "No, Death my love. *You* are not ready." "You are wrong, I--" "Death, I am *old*. Far older than I have any right to be. Far older than I *want* to be. I treasure our times together, the games, the talks, the advice you gave me -- you were always as wise as you were old. You know, you were the one constant in my life. The one unmoving rock that I built my world upon. But now, my dear, my world ends." Death said nothing for a time. "I- I shall play for you." He reached over to the cards on Mary's bed, and turned the first over. It was an ace. Mary winced. "Please, don't look like that," he said. "Please." "Then let me go." "I... can't. I'm sorry." He reached for the second card, his arm trembling beneath his cloak as his fingers neared. Mary moved her own hand very slowly from her side. Death saw the extra card she held. A two of hearts. "Mary, *why?*." "I love you," she whispered as she placed the card by the ace. "Always." For a long while Death sat there in silence, watching the only human he had ever cared about as her chest stopped moving. Eventually, he leaned forward and drew her eyelids down. "Goodbye, Mary."

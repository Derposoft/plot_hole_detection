A priority file materialized in my mental buffer, seeking access to my cerebrex core. It had passed the standard security sweeps and was properly sourced, but I still viewed it with skepticism. It wouldn't be the first time a malignant tried to swim in through a phish. Secure packages were worse than the spam littering the WISPnet. You knew the spam for what it was. It just persisted as ethereal flotsam, clogging up the back and forth. Secure packages were the wolf in sheep's clothes. They carried the tastiest treats and the dirtiest tricks. I erected a second set of mental firewalls around the file. I had enough wetware upgrades to be well enough prepared for anything short of M&M's -- mafia and military -- not that there was to separate 'em these days. After a few more scans, I offered my DNAcrypter. The package looked legit. Pathed in from the tracing co, RootMap. I heaved a sigh of relief. I'd been expecting it, but it had come faster than I'd led to believe. I didn't have the cred to go expedited and this had hopped there and back in less than a day. A mental nudge pressed against my consciousness, a not-so-subtle suggestion I open the package. I pushed it aside, wanting a moment to steel my nerves. This moment had been twenty-one years in the making. That was a long time to slum in Luna. A long time to be fighting for food and for survival. A long time to be an orphan. Maybe the results would just confirm that who I had been was who I was going to be. That I was Unlinked, split off from the rest of Humanity and adrift. I wouldn't be the first. Half my crew in Luna had already done their tests and most of 'em got zeroed on Links. I told myself I didn't need a Link. That I'd made it this far and it was fine to spend the rest of my breaths with the family I had built. But I didn't believe it. Links were hope. They were possibilities. It was hope for a way out of this shitty grind. I wasn't looking for Easy Street, I just wanted to be out of the Outs. I prodded at the package, and it unfurled, downloading its contents into my consciousness. Knowledge blossomed, assimilating itself into my thoughts. Something was wrong. I had Links, but they were the wrong ones. I was supposed to have UpLinks. SideLinks. Not DownLinks. It didn't make any sense. I had twenty DownLinks. Even two Trip DLs -- great grandkids. "What the hell?" One surviving son. Three other children, now deceased. Fifteen grands. I tried to process it. Tried to run through all of the explanations. Tried to find some way out of the conclusion that I'd already reached. I gasped for air, feeling suffocated. I'd gone from a nobody to the wrong type of somebody. I was twenty-one. But this was my second life. I was a clone. The secondary package hidden within the message downloaded, breaching my firewall like it was a toy. I was a clone. I was being tracked. **Platypus OUT.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/perilousplatypus

The clapping rang out around the rocky red walls as the Devil sat on his throne looking down at Clyde. "Congratulations, Clyde, and welcome to hell." Clyde took a moment to look around, doing his best to take in the strange surroundings. Peering up at the Devil, he nodded his head. "Hello," said Clyde. The Devil held his hand out and a large book burst in to existence, "You're very special, Clyde. Very special, indeed." He took the book and peeled open the cover. "You're the first person to enter my domain, Clyde. This intrigues me like nothing before." Clyde stood idly, oddly unimpressed by what was transpiring in front of him. "This book, aptly named 'The Crimes of Clyde', contains every sin you committed, and, oh my, it's rather thick," said the Devil, running his finger over the first page. "Your first punishment will be sitting through the reading of all your misdemeanors. May we remind you of your infidelity." Clyde continued to stand unaffected. The Devil began to rattle off the list contained within The Crimes of Clyde. "And I begin: * Thinking it's funny to shout out fake spoilers for films/TV shows people are about to watch. * Posting Minion memes on Facebook. * Singing along to every song on the radio while at work. * Not resetting the time on the microwave after using it. * Taking your phone out and sitting it on the table while eating with friends. * Biting the fork when eating food. * Thinking it's funny to touch people who have asked not to be touched. * Texting during a movie then being upset when called out on it. * Listening to music from your phone speaker on public transport. * Saying the words 'quick question'. * Stopping in the middle of streets when people are walking behind you. * Whistling. * Calling people out on technicalities when debating because you're incapable of admitting you're wrong. * Vaguebooking. * Wearing socks with Crocs. * Taking pictures of your food. * Forcing people to watch YouTube videos on your phone when they clearly don't want to. * Saying the word 'memes' in real life. * Using the word 'literally' when it doesn't apply. * Becoming unjustly upset when your housemates ask you to clean up after yourself. Clyde interrupted, "Is this going to take much longer?" "You're clearly a cunt Clyde. This is going to take forever." **** I write shitty, silly stories on /r/BillMurrayMovies. Feel free to come along, not laugh at any of them and leave some judgement.

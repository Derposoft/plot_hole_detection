*Hey there, Roomie! How was your day?* *The next time you spot my web, could you please not sweep it away?* *I put a lot of effort into crafting this silky smooth nest;* *With these threads that hold my food and keep me still as I rest.* **Please excuse me Mister Spider, if I can't mask my fear.** **It's just that your cheery voice isn't what I expected to hear.** **I was hoping to have a friendly chat with a dog or some cats.** **Not some creepy little dude who's content with feasting on gnats.** *I'm not as creepy as I look and I'm always able to talk.* *All you'll get out of your dog are requests for treats or a walk.* *And forget those friggin' cats, they make my hairs stand on end.* *You can see it in their eyes; they'll never call you their friend.* **Fair enough, little dude. My cat is kind of a dick.** **But how can I be sure your kindness isn't some form of trick?** **You seem pretty friendly but I can sense you're annoyed.** **Are you seeking your revenge for all the webs I've destroyed?** *I wouldn't hold a grudge even if our new friendship goes south.* *Trust me, my dude, you won't wake up with dead flies in your mouth.* *I can keep my webs out of the way if it'll put your mind at ease.* *But if you'd like, I can pack up my shit and move outside to the trees*. **I won't boot you out, man. Honestly, you seem pretty chill.** **And you're doing me a solid with all the mosquitoes you kill.** **But I'm sad to say your appearance could cause quite a fright.** **If I have some guests over could you please stay out of sight?** *I hear you loud and clear bro, I'll disappear like a ghost.* *Wouldn't want those girls from the club to think you're a terrible host.* *To think I'd meet a human who's not eager to snuff out my life.* *This is great I can't wait until you meet my wife!* **Hold up, your wife? There's another eight-legged guest staying near?** **And there was a tone in your voice that sounded an awful lot like fear...** **I know you're excited but try to stay calm and be real.** **You've made friends with a human; how will that make your wife feel?** *Alas, it's true the wrath of my wife can give me a bit of a scare* *We hit the sheets, she laid some eggs, and I haven't been back to her lair* *It's not that she's quick to spring into a sudden murderous mood* *It's just that for us, it's customary for the male to become his woman's food...* **That's pretty rough but at least you can look forward to kids.** **And if I have an army of spiders, I'll make people flip their lids!** **But for you, I imagine it won't seem nearly as fun.** **A legion of kids, will you even have time to name each one?** *Honestly it's for the best that I try to keep my distance* *They'll never know I'm their father or be aware of my existence.* *Just keep your eyes open and I'll let you know when the timing is right.* *When they're born open your windows and let the wind give them flight* **So they glide out into the world, swiftly vacating my house?** **Once they're gone, will you try to reconnect with your spouse?** *Probably not, dude. I love her but I'd like to keep my head* *I might just go chill in the attic and check out her sister's bed...* **END** (I didn't really have a story in mind for this prompt...) *Edit: Holy crap! Thanks for the kind words, people! *Edit 2: Holier Crap!! Is that a gold star?

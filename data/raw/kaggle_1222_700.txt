"It's getting harder." Mavelon said, scrolling down his iPad, "Not as much is going through." Lauris shrugged, "No surprise in that, they've patched most of the gaps." He paused for a moment, "You ever regret going White Hat?" "I don't think I'm cut out for Grey," a pause, "definitely not Black." "Yeah." "I'm not going to tear a hole in the Source just to get a new spell. I do it clean or not at all." "Yeah," Lauris replied, his voice distant. "I miss Skipping though. That was great." Being able to get from Point A to Point B without bothering with the line in between had made life a lot easier. They all knew it wouldn't last though, not something that disruptive. Mavelon still remembered when the Admins patched it out, taking away the wrinkle the Whites used for Skipping. The Blacks still had Tearing of course. They just seemed to get stronger as the Admins patched the Whites to pieces. That was the advantage of walking the darker paths of magic. You could lay a backdoor in a core substrata of the Source and not worry about the side effects. Taking the Black was for people that didn't mind putting the universe below them. Didn't mind a bit of destruction if it got them what they wanted. "Remember Rollbacks?" Lauris sighed. The ability to set back any person connected to the Source by a few minutes had been one of the most powerful ways to heal people for a long time. Everyone hoped it would last, but it was gone. Patched away. "Why do you think the Admins take all of the stuff from the Whites so much? We're the good guys." "It's easier. We're looking for loopholes in the Source, not rewriting the Code. A lot easier to smooth out a wrinkle then repair a hole," Mavelon tapped an icon on his iPad, "Besides, I don't think they think we're the good guys." The iPad glowed for a moment and then a portal formed across the room. "They just think of us as another bunch of people ruining their project." Lauris' eyes fixed on that portal, "What is that?" "It's new," Mavelon voice took on a giddy tone. It had been a while since a new Spell had been created by the Whites. This was his first. Once it got out, he'd be granted a higher Order. The Spell had been in Alpha for a long time. "New? When? Who?" A look passed over his features as he walked toward the portal. "Three months ago," a little giggle, "Me." "You've had a new spell for *three months* and you didn't tell me?" Lauris turned on his friend, the hurt evident. "I didn't even know what it was for the first two months. I couldn't risk someone getting hurt while I was in Alpha. But it's ready for Beta. Ready for someone else." Mavelon rose and placed a hand on his friend's shoulder, "You're the first, Lauris." "What does it do?" "It gets us version access to the Source, Lauris," he walked toward the portal, "it lets us Parse what the Admins have been doing." "You mean we can get to the Patch Notes?" Lauris asked. "Yeah. Parsing it is hard, but we can see what they've been changing," he paused for a moment, "we can also call back prior versions of the universe." "Call back?" "Lauris, we can bring back the old Spells," he scrolled through his iPad. "We can pull back each version one time per user. Once the user version check hits us and a non-current version is detected, they delete it from our root access. But we get that version until then." "You're saying every patch, every version of the universe? We can get access until a version check?" Lauris asked, hopping from foot to foot in excitement. "Every one." "How often does the version check run?" "Once every hour at the top of the hour. So you can run an old version for up to 59 minutes." "Skipping...Rollbacks...Cut&Paste...Undo...all of them?" Mavelon nodded, "All of them." "We could fight the Black Hats with this." Mavelon nodded again. Finally. **Platypus out.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

The acorn basked in the warm heat of the summer sun. It was surrounded by the bright green leaves of the tall, tall tree. And that was all that the acorn had ever known, or wanted to know. But then the cold came, and the leaves began to change: to vivid red, fiery orange, and bright yellow. Wind howled and rain came pouring down, causing the old tree to shake. The acorn clung to the branch with all its might even as the leaves grew brittle and began to fall. And when the grass far below was no longer visible under the thick carpet of fall foliage, the acorn could hold on no longer. It plummeted toward the ground, away from the comfortable branch of the mighty tree. And the acorn was scared. It was cold and lonely on the ground. The leaves that the acorn had known so well on the branch were gone; all that remained were dried husks that only looked like its old friends. They began to crumble, and the acorn experienced ice and snow for the first time. It sought shelter from the cold in the grimy, uncomfortable dirt. But life was so much more miserable now than it was back on the branches. The acorn wondered why all of this was happening to it. "Is anyone else out there?" the acorn desperately called. "Anyone at all?" "I am here," the roots answered from deep within the earth. The voice was not too dissimilar from the branch's, but older and wizened. "I've always been here." "I'm scared," the acorn told the roots. "I want to go back to the branch where it was warm and safe." Even as it spoke, the ground around the acorn was freezing solid, and a thick blanket of snow carpeted the ground. The remains of the leaves were gone as well. "It will be OK," the roots answered. "This is the way of things. I've enjoyed many summers and endured many winters. And every time, the acorns fear that the summer will never come. But I know it will." The acorn trusted the roots. But the winter cold never ended. Wind howled through the trees. The blanket of snow melted, then another storm passed and an even thicker layer came. The acorn tried to go deeper into the dirt but it was too cold and hard. "Patience," the roots advised. The acorn wasn't sure how much longer it could go on like this. But then a bird began to sing. "The sun is out," the roots advised the acorn. "See for yourself." The acorn tried to look from deep under the soil, but it couldn't see. Though the acorn hated the dirt, it was at least familiar now, and leaving was a scary prospect. But as the Acorn peered upward, it realized that now the ground wasn't so cold, or so hard. So the acorn stretched and poked above the surface for the first time in ages. It had forgotten the smell of the air and the warmth of the sun! And the forest was so different! Trees were in bloom, and even flowers were growing in between the mighty oaks. The branches had spoken of flowers, but the acorn had been too young to remember them. "Well?" the roots asked the acorn. "Better?" The acorn unfurled its first leaves and soaked in the spring. "Better," it answered.

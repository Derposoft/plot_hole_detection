I ran my finger along the frayed volumes until I found the single, ancient tome I was searching for. As I plucked it from its shelf, a plume of dust exploded around me, forcing me to step back, coughing and wheezing. I half expected a wizard to appear as the ephemeral fog settled on the ground. There was nothing there, of course, apart from the ornately carved bookshelf. The book was a burnt brown and whilst still a thick volume, was noticeably lighter than my own had been. My own... *my own book of death*. A biography that charted my life up to now. Up to stumbling upon the Library of Threads and closing the door after me, accidentally locking myself inside. I knew why the entries stopped where they did, after me finding the library. *I knew I wasn't getting out of here*. There was only one door, and it wouldn't budge no matter how hard I rammed my shoulder against it. The book in my hands had that musty, comforting smell all old books tend to have. I blinked back my tears, determined to distract myself from my rumbling stomach and dry throat. I placed the book down on the floor and sat in front of it, legs folded, flipping it open to the appendix. Thousands of names were listed. Dozens of other *Karens*, even. It took a moment to find my surname. There must have been a mistake. *Hundreds of pages were attributed to me*. This person that I couldn't even recall meeting, who had only had a single line in my own book, had hundreds of pages on me. It must be a different Karen that shared my surname. *It wasn't.* I began to read. >"Mind if I join you?" said Karen, as she approached the building's ledge. The fading sun cast a pastel orange over the street below, softening the city's imperfections, and turning the more pleasing sights into *objet d'art*. >The man glanced over his shoulder. He was pale, and there was a sheen over his face as if he was ill. Karen didn't notice. >"Free world," he said, shrugging. >The concrete felt cold and rough under Karen as she sat down next to him. She swung her legs around, so that they dangled besides his. >"Karen, by the way," she said, before waiting for a response that didn't come. >"Not the best spot for fishing," she attempted, lighting a cigarette. She offered the box to the man; he raised a hand and shook his head. >"You don't mind if I do?" she said, already puffing a hazy mist over the city. "Chilly up here." >For a while, they sat silently watching the beams of the headlights sail by far below. Then, the man spoke. >"You ever think about leaning forward and"--he clapped his hands--"*splat*?" >"*Splat?*" Karen frowned. "No, not really. Maybe of falling in general, occasionally. Of what the wind would feel like against my face, and that rush you'd get for a few seconds. I wonder what pose I'd do... Superman, I guess. It's the classic." >"I think about it sometimes." >"...had a rough day?" >The man sighed. "Yeah. I got some bad news." >"Sorry to hear that." >"Thanks." >Karen took another puff. >"So. What news?" >"... got a problem with my liver." >"Oh, what kinda problem?" >"Cancer." >"Oh." Karen turned and looked at the man. She finally noticed how pale he looked. How worn out. Like a piece of elastic stretched to the point of tearing. Then she noticed his hands. The silver band around his finger. >"You've not told her yet?" >The man looked at Karen, then down at his ring. "No. I was just... *I don't know*." >"Got kids?" >"Yeah. Little girl," he said proudly. He opened his jacket and pulled out his wallet. There was a picture of a kid, couldn't have been more than six, grinning broadly. >"She's cute." >"Takes after her pop," the man joked. >"If you say so!" >"It's just... it'll be hard for them, you know. To watch a slow decline. All the treatments. All the hope, you know? It'll just make it worse in the end." >"Be harder losing a father when they might not have to." >"... maybe." >"You kidding? You can't really think-" >He shook his head. "I don't know." >"If I was your daughter, I sure as hell would want my pop to fight for me. To never give up on me. It's what dads do." >Karen patted him on his back, then glanced at her watch. "Shit, I got to get back to work. See you around." I felt scolding tears spill down my cheeks as I flicked forward a few pages. He told them. His wife held his hand as he entered the hospital to begin chemotherapy. I skipped a few more. Then a few hundred. I landed on, and read, the entire chapter on his daughter's graduation. He was so proud. He was somehow prouder still, on the day he walked her down the aisle. Then, I came across another section with my name in it. My hands began to tremble as I read. >Perhaps it was serendipity that drew David to the Thread Library, and to Karen. >Perhaps it was simply fate that allowed David to save Karen, this time around. >"Hello? Is anyone here?" he yelled as he stepped inside. >Fate that he found her sitting there, weeping, in front of the ancient tome. That he was able to take her hand and lead her out of the library. My hands trembled as I closed the book and held my breath. *Hoping.* *Praying.* ... ... ... "Hello? Is anyone here?"

Accessing...* "Please remain seated," Inquisitor Quintus said, holding up one gloved finger. "Truth is not subjective. Bear that in mind." The shadows crawled and churned in the corners of the small cell. Its occupant, an unshaven man in an archaic space suit, stopped himself mid-motion and sat back down with his elbows leaning on the metal desk. "W-what?" the man said, his eyes wide. "What's going on? Who are you?" "I am a representative of the holy ordos, and it is my job to determine if you're telling the truth... or if your mind has been tainted by your journey through the warp." "The what?" The man threw up his hand in frustration. "My crew and I just left the Milky Way, before you shot us down! We're just explorers! Our rocket has no weapons." "Don't exert yourself," Quintus said dismissively. "The initial report states that you claim to be from a planet called Earth. Is that correct?" "Yes! Please, we're not a violent species. Not really. We mean no harm." Quintus ran a hand through his silvery locks. This man had clearly lost his wits. If it wasn't for the strange circumstances surrounding the ship, Quintus would happily have handed him over to the Ordo Hereticus. "Would you be able to point out your homeworld on a star map?" the Inquisitor said and pressed a few buttons on the cogitator. The holographic image of the galaxy swirled to life over the table. Quintus made sure to remove all labels and names of the stars and their systems. The man's mouth opened wide, and probingly, he put his hand through the three-dimensional image. Trembling slightly, his finger pointed at one particular star, which made the inquisitor's eyes narrow in suspicion. Quintus flicked his fingers, and a single system replaced all the twinkling stars. "That one," the man said and pointed at the third planet from the center. "Are you certain?" Quintus's face hardened. "Remember what I said about truth." "I swear on my life. That's where I'm from." "And you call this world... *dirt*?" "Earth, yes. That's our name for it," the man said nervously. The solar system flickered. Quintus leaned back in his chair, examining the man before him. If he was lying, he did a damned good job at it. "Tell me something, Mr. Moore," Quintus said. "What's your world like?" The man's eyes stared up at the ceiling. "We have big seas... six continents... seven if you count Antarctica. We have forests... mountains... deserts... big cities... We're pretty diverse, I'd say." "And what do you call your closest planets?" "Venus and Mars." The inquisitor's lips stretched into a tight minus. The man was either lying through his teeth or else had somehow gotten lost in a warp storm. Quintus had run all his info through the databanks - no records existed of him. He claimed to be from Holy Terra, but his testimony didn't hold up to the facts. And yet... "Would you be able to find your way back to your homeworld?" "If you can recover the piloting system from the rocket you blew up, then maybe!" "What year do you think it is?" "2431," the man said, with a serious face. The strange technology of the spacecraft that belonged to the man was a combination of extremely outdated and almost arcane. It had no warp drive - that was the biggest concern. But if Quintus could recover the pieces and reconstruct them, perhaps he could trace back the route of this man. It could change everything. "I'll hand you over to the Knights of Titan for more in-depth cleansing. Then you'll help me reassemble your spacecraft," Quintus said and rose out his chair. "Welcome to the 41st millennium, Mr. Moore." *Station 333109 [888.M41]: Interrogation log 1... Closing...* *** r/Lilwa_Dexel

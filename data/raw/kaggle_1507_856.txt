I groaned as I loaded the last of my laundry into the machine. Another night, another fight. How did she *do* it? He had sworn he had covered his tracks well... the initial strike hadn't even been in person! Just drop a disc in the company parking garage, and next thing you know, you've got a dozen different passwords because people *love* cat videos. Then just drop in the building and download what you want off their servers. Easy. Until Scarlet Shot shows up while you're making your get away and complete wrecks your shit with a few bullets. Had to give it to her: she's a hell of a shot for shooting off my belt without shooting me. Unfortunately, that meant the whole thing fell about 50 stories and completely destroyed the drives. Still, couldn't complain too much after she tackled me... I grinned and backed up to kick the dryer close. "Hey!" "Woah! Hey, I'm sorry, miss..." I turned around to see a young woman with red hair and green eyes. Apartment 3A, upstairs from me. Probably here with the water out in our building, like I was. But she had a fierce black eye. I could trace the rope burn on her wrist where my whip had caught her, trying to get her gun out of her hand (she had just pulled out a second, smaller one after that -- guess she'd learned from our previous fight...) I could almost see the imprint of my boot heel above her knee where I'd had to kick her off. Of course, if all of that hadn't been telling enough, the deep red suit she was trying to desperately cover in her basket was enough. How hadn't I seen it before? I smiled. "Why, hello, Scar--" She grabbed my shirt and pulled me down to meet her eyes. "You finish that, *Drake*, and I swear the cops will find a reason to raid your apartment." Ooh. When'd she find out my first name? "I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage, then. I hadn't thought to spy on my neighbors to get their names." She sniffed and let me go. "*I* didn't. Mrs. Lane introduced us when I moved in, but you just waved us off." That sounded about right. I usually ignored Mrs. Lane unless she was demanding to be let in to check the apartment, which usually meant storing away my latest project. No wonder I hadn't put two and two together. A pretty girl being busted up every time I was? It was easy to buy the martial arts training excuse. Especially when she *did* go to the dojo regularly. "I'm very sorry I did, then. Maybe we can start over?" She raised an eyebrow and didn't take my offered hand. "I'm just here to do my laundry. *Not* play nice." "Hey, funny thing! So am I! But that doesn't mean we *couldn't*." Okay, maybe I was coming on too strong. I suppose I deserved the elbow to the gut as she turned away to load her clothes in the driers down at the far end. Still, I waited until hers had to started to start mine. Didn't hurt to linger a bit. She settled on the plastic monstrosities laundromats like to call chairs and pulled out a phone. One of the new Apple products. I sat on the table opposite her. "Didn't know heroing paid that well." "Are you just going to annoy me while my laundry's going?" "No... just.... sorry about your eye." "What?" She looked up. Damn, I'd hit her hard. She looked like a poster child for a domestic abuse campaign. I pointed to my eye. "Your eye. Sorry about it. Didn't think I'd gotten you that hard." "It's nothing. I've gotten harder hits at my gym." "Right... right... still, I'll try to avoid your face from now on." "I don't need any favors from *you*." And she's back to the phone. Damn it. "Of course not, but I figure I owe you a favor. See, you're *not* calling the cops right now, and you haven't before this. Which means either you figured it out before I did, or you've just decided to keep silent. So, you know, I can at least make your neighbors stop asking how you got hurt this time." "You've heard that much, but not my *name*?" Finally, got her attention. "You're 3A. That's all I needed. But, hey, tell me your name, and I'll go get us some ice cream. Make it an official truce for today while we desperately wait for the water lines to be fixed." A laugh. A small win. "I'm going to go back to my car. I don't need ice cream with somebody who doesn't know my name." "Then after I learn your name?" She just chuckled and shook her head as she exited the building, heading to the Oldsmobile outside the doors. Why did her driving the land yacht not surprise me? But Dolmen was going to have to wait for his files. I had a new campaign to start. *** Did a sort of prequel here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/95jk1a/wp_the_hero_and_villain_are_roommates_but_dont/e3tqqjy/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/95jk1a/wp_the_hero_and_villain_are_roommates_but_dont/e3tqqjy/?context=3)

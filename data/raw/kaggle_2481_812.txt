Death continued stroking his chin, floating back and forth akin to something that might be considered pacing if snakes weren't constantly falling out of his cloak and disintegrating on contact with the ground. "What about like, you can't die by food poi-- no, that just doesn't..." he floated away again, banging the staff end of his scythe on the floor in frustration. "Excuse me, um, Mr. Death?" I asked, moving the covers I was hiding behind a fraction of an inch. He stopped in place, waiting. Even the snakes stopped falling out. "Why is it that I have to be given powers?" "Ah, that's the thing with the undead. When you come back to life, you can't be in the same form you were, otherwise people will know you didn't actually die. The supernatural really sells it." "But I *didn't* die," I stressed, patting my chest. "Really, though?" he asked, squinting his eyes, unconvinced. "I saw the blood on your bed, and even the teeth left behind in the room. Heck, your body was there, smoldered by the fire in your room," he looked up in thought while a cockroach skittered from his eye to his ear. "Yes, that was all planted evidence so my father's ad--" "Yes, yes, your advisor killed you, I'm working around the idea that you didn't actually die. Quite the--" "But I was never in danger of dying!" I yelled. He turned to actually look at me, looking deep into my eyes and pulling the truth with his gaze. I saw understanding come into his eyes and I finally got the feeling we were on the same page. "You no longer feel fire on your flesh!" he said excitedly, a cobra falling from his sleeve as he waved it triumphantly. "What?" "You were burned to death! It'll be an irony to show that even though they tried to burn you, you are completely fine. Oh, that's excellent. Undead are normally pretty affected by fire, since the brain burns nicely. I like that distinction, don't you?" he asked, not looking at me. "But I wasn't bur--" "Oh, I can't wait to see the look on King Ravier's face when he sees that you're still alive and ready to take back the throne. He'd have to be your advisor again! Or.." he looked longingly at his scythe and swished it in the air excitedly. "Please, you must understand, I'm in hiding to get control of my life once again. I don't want to go back and confront Ravier once more. I'm happy to live my days here," I made a gesture to my quaint hobble. He looked at me with sympathy. "I know you're scared--" "You're clearly not listening," I said as he floated toward me. "But you are impervious to flames now. And I'll imbue you with bravery," he said, tapping my forehead with the blade of his scythe. My body felt completely invigorated, like I was ready to challenge anything. Even death itself. I stood up to really tell him off now. As soon as I opened my mouth, Death looked excited and snapped his fingers. The world spun around me and the only thing that anchored me was what I was going to say. Despite not being on solid footing, I began screaming out at Death, telling him exactly how I felt, "Try as you might, I won't become your pawn! Just let me live you crazed lunatic!" My vision came under control and I saw myself standing before the throne, former advisor Ravier with a crown on his head looking at me in complete shock with his court soldiers on the ground, screaming in fear. Behind him was Death, floating with a jovial thumbs up and his scythe at the ready. It took me a moment longer to see what the soldiers were continuing to scream about. My body was set on fire, a flame crown forming on my head. I sighed. "Just give me the throne so I can be done with this?" I asked Ravier. He yelped and collapsed out of the chair, face first. He sputtered what was supposed to be an apology and scampered out of the room. I rubbed my temples and went to sit on the throne while Death looked at me with an expectancy like dog waiting for a stick to be thrown. "Fine, and execute him too," I ordered the guards. They screamed in unison and chased after their failed king, Death flying frantically behind them. I looked at my empty throne room and felt its expansiveness spread out before me. It was lonely and its silence was deafening. As the flames starved themselves out on my body, I thought of what to do in this new position, which was likely worse off than I was three minutes ago. _______________________________________________________ For more stories, come check out r/Nazer_the_Lazer!

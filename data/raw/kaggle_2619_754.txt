"Citizens of the Federation." War Czar Mitya Kalishinov stared directly into the camera. His tall, strong form, clad in the midnight black of the Human military, filled only a portion of the screen. Behind him was the interior of his ship, the *Hades*, itself a mix of black paneling and red lighting. To his sides stood the proud men and women of the *Hades.* Looming over his head was a floating map displaying the one thousand, eight hundred and thirty-five ships of the Second Armada. At first, the man did not speak after the initial greeting. Instead, he let the image cement itself in the minds of the viewers. They would be watching from across the Federation, hiding in their rat warrens and fragile cities. They thought themselves strong. The War Czar knew otherwise. Finally, he spoke. "I am War Czar Kalishinov, Supreme Commander of Humanity's Astra Militaris. I speak for Earth's government on the matter of the Federation Council's rejection of Humanity's application for admission." He cleared his throat and then his eyes began to move slightly from left to right as he read from the prompter. "Humanity's application to the Federation Council was made as a gesture of goodwill. Formed out of a desire to align Human interests with the other denizens of our galactic neighborhood. This application was genuinely made, though it was only supported by a thin margin of qualified citizens." The eyes stopped scanning from left to right and instead peered at the camera again. The next words were slower, more deliberate, "The rejection of our application has freed us from the restrictions we willingly placed upon ourselves in an effort to find a compromise with the Federation. These limitations curtailed our actions, and yolked Humanity's progress to the whims of foreign beings in foreign lands. We are thankful to have this obstacle removed." Mitya smiled, the first sign of emotion during the presentation, "I wish the Federation luck in what is to come." The video feed went dark. Mitya turned to his side, nodding to his Executive Officer, "XO Lewis, transmit and confirm Thoran transit orders with the Second Armada." Executive Officer Madison Lewis, a short, stocky woman with a broad jaw and buzzed grey hair, saluted Mitya, "Yes, sir." She turned on her heel and made her way over to the fleet comms controller. She leaned over and had brief conversation before returning to the Czar, who had taken his seat at the center of the command deck. "Sir, transit to Thoran has been charted with the navigational route transmitted and confirmed to all ships within the Second Armada. Estimated travel time is four hours and thirty-five minutes. The transit will required thirteen chutes." Mitya nodded, "Very good, XO. See that nothing comes undone during during the A to B." The XO saluted and took her own position a few feet from the Czar's command chair. Mitya opened a small panel in the left armrest of his chair and pressed a bright red button. He leaned back in his chair, pressing firmly against the flesh of the black leather. A moment later, a spine from the chair pressed against his neck and then inserted itself just beneath the base of his skull. The Czar's eyes rolled up in his head and he slumped down. Mitya's consciousness floated for a moment in the etherium of buffer space as his brain was scanned and loaded. A moment later, the scan was complete, a symbiote AI formed, and the SAI was transmitted to Earth Command. The symbiote would act as his proxy on the Command Council once he was out of communications range, permitting him to be two places at once. It was not a perfect solution, but it was far superior to the alternative of courier messages or command fragmentation. Trials on symbiote decision trees showed a 99.999999999998% overlap with their source trees at inception. Of course, that percentage decreased as lived experience diverged from scanned experience, but no solution could be perfect. The spine retracted and Mitya opened his eyes. The scanning process took less than a minute, but the aftereffects of the scan always left a short period of disorientation. Mitya was no stranger to this feeling and handled it with little distraction. Once his head cleared, he opened an all hands channel to the *Hades.* "Soldiers of the *Hades*, we make for Thoran to rendezvous with our new allies." A pause. "Then we ready for war. All hands, battle stations." **Platypus OUT.** **Want MOAR Peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

The Master lifted his cane off of his throne in the room of gathering, leaned on it. He moved carefully, slowly to the glowing box in one corner of the room. He pressed a thin finger against the side of the box, and the glowing disappeared. I stood up to greet him as he turned to me. I looked up at his eyes. They were losing their color. Most Masters think dogs don't notice things, but I do. I have been a good dog to my Master, and I have noticed many things. I noticed when he was not moving in his bed one morning. I noticed when another Master was going to attack mine from behind. I noticed when my Master brought home a new, tiny Master with no motor skills and a high-pitched squeal. "George, ya ole mutt," my Master chuckled, reaching down to scratch my neck. I loved it when he scratched my neck! As he pulled his hand back, I looked back into his eyes and tilted my head. My Master sat back down in his soft throne, leaned forward. "I know, boy-o," he whispered, lifting my head with his hand, holding his cane in his other, "I'm not looking so good. I'm not moving as fast as I used to, I can't do all of the things I used to do with you." Moisture began to form around his eyes. I have seen this before, he is sad. My Master is sad, but why? Is it because he is getting old? Is it because of me? Did I do something wrong? I nudged my nose closer to him, making him chuckle. "No, no, no," my Master smiled, "you're good, ole boy, you're good." Okay, good, it wasn't me. "I do want to talk to you, though." My Master stood up briefly then dropped to one knee, laying his cane on the ground. "Sit for me, Georgie. I'm going to be going to the hospital soon. I hope this is just for some tests, but I'm not sure." I tilted my head again. What is a "hospital"? Is it like Hell? Or, in other words, the Vet? "This is looking like my last trip to the hospital, boy-o." Something about his tone did not sound right to me. Moisture was appearing in his eyes again. Why is my Master so sad now? What is going on? I scooted a little closer to him, licking his hand. Maybe licking his hand would make him feel better. "Thank you, boy," my Master said, stroking my head. "You've been a good boy so far. We've had some pretty fun times, too. Remember those muggers?" He laughed a big laugh this time. "What a time! Good thing I had this with me." He picked up his cane, waved it at me. My tail wagged. "I want you to know, boy-o, that I love you and that you have been the best friend anyone could have." I have no idea what he just said, but he looked intensely into my eyes, and the moisture was gone, so I think he was happy. My tail continued to wag. I licked his hand again. My Master pressed his head to mine. We remained there for a good long while. My tail continued to wag. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ I know this is done to death, but I do have to say...

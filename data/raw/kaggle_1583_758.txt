I gripped Marie's shoulders. "It's all going to be okay. Just stay calm!" "It's not okay! Nothing's okay! M-Mark's dead! Jessie! A-And Kass...!" Her shaking would not stop. And it's not as if I couldn't have understood it. We'd just seen the dismembered bodies of our best friends scattered across the corridors of this hotel. I sighed. "I know. But we're safe now, do you understand? We're locked in. We've barricaded the doors and windows. I've checked, and the air vent isn't big enough for him to get through. He can't get to us from below or above. We've got a gun. He doesn't. The police are on their way. We'll make it through this!" There was nothing I could do to reach her, however. Why did things turn out like this? All we wanted was to have a good time before summer break was over. Jessie... we were supposed to be in a study group together this year. She was finally getting out of her shell, too... And now? She was dead. Because of me. Because I'd invited her along. Because I wanted a cheap shot at making out with her. *Fuck!* "We won't die here." I told Marie. "We won't die here." What was I saying, though? My fault? No. It was that masked fucker's fault. I call him that, but it's not like it was a secret who he was. That goddamn caretaker's son. I couldn't believe he'd actually tried to play dead. Like we'd fall for that after seeing actual corpses. "N-Nathan..." Marie hugged me. "I-I... I don't..." "Marie?" She began to cough. Her shakes turned into convulsions. "Marie!" She was gurgling blood. "Marie?! Fuck! Marie?!" My phone rang. Thinking it was the police, I instinctively picked it up. "The poison should be kicking in right about now." The voice on the other end said. "Oh, come on. Think back. I'm the cook in this place. Did you really think I wouldn't have taken the chance when I had it?" A fake chuckle. "Props on seeing through me playing dead. But it won't help you now, will it?" "Fuck you!" I screamed. "Well, I will admit, I'm not in a good position myself. You being able to call the police was something I'd taken for granted. Murders in an old house on the hill? The kids never call the cops. I cut the lines, but forgot to steal your cell phones. Stupid mistake." "They're going to track you down, and they're gonna kill ya, you hear?!" I growled. "By the time they show up, I'll just surrender. Life in prison probably isn't so bad. Especially since I got what I wanted out of this. But you shouldn't be worrying about me at the moment." Marie was on her knees, blood seeping from her mouth. "I have the antidote. She can still be saved. All you need to do is remove the barricades from the window and let me in." "Do you think I'm a fucking idiot?! You'll just kill us both!" "And if I told you I'll only kill you? That I'll respect your brave sacrifice?" "I'd say you're full of shit." "You're right. I am." A deep sigh. "Was worth a shot, though, wasn't it?" "Dammit! Marie...!" "Truth be told, there's nothing more you can do for her. If she's spitting out blood, the poison's spread through most of her body. She'll be dead in a matter of moments. If it's any consolation, you won't have to mourn her." "What... do you mean?" "This phone call has just been a distraction. I've spent the last five minutes pumping gas into that room of yours. I'm thinking if you don't blow up on your own, I'll strike a match at some point." My knees began to shake. "Of course, this doesn't have to end that way. Just open the window, and hop out. You'll have to leave the girl behind, though. I can't see you getting far dragging her along." I knew he wasn't bluffing. But I wasn't stupid enough to actually try and go out through the window. Instead, I began pushing furniture away from the door. Marie looked at me. Still gurgling. Tears running down her cheeks. She was trying to tell me something. Reaching out to me. Begging me not to leave her behind? Maybe. "I'm sorry, Marie. But I have to save myself." I pulled the door open. And there he was. The masked killer. "Looks like I'm not the only one that made a leap in logic tonight, eh?"

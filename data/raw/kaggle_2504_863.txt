Look, I'm not a bad student. I go to class. I complete my assignments. I even attend office hours. All my assignments get completed and handed in on time. I have like 65% in the class, so I'm doing decent. But apparently so is everyone else. The prof has this stupid bell curve scaling system. If the class average is too high, he gives everyone a flat grade reduction to lower our average to that juicy 70% score. Guess what the class average is? 95%. Fucking **95%.** How the hell does a class of 300 people average 95%? What do these people do, study everyday? The monsters. So now I'm sitting with a 40% mark in the class thanks to the scaling system. All because other people are doing better than me. During office hours, the prof recommended I get a tutor, but who the hell wants to drop another sixty bucks an hour on extra schooling? And I don't even like languages. I was just taking it to help me out with medical terminology. My roommate's been harping on about it too. "You should study, man," he'd say, while he's cooking instant noodles on the stovetop. "I took the course last year, could help you get the pass." Yeah, thanks Ryan. Cause having a tutor who lives with me is **completely** ideal. I'm getting a little off-track. Ryan told me I came home from a pub one night, stumbling around like my body was made of left feet, when I decided to study Latin. Yeah, crazy, I know. But I did my best work when I was drunk, like making the toilet paper mummy costume or building a replacement table leg out of lego. Fine stuff. And just like that, I summoned a demon. But, man, this demon isn't even cool. He's everything I thought a demon wouldn't be. He's studious. He cooks and cleans. He never brings home a lady caller. Hell, he's even fluent in Latin. That brings us to the present. Where I'm currently being tutored by the guy. "Mark, we need to use common Latin phrases in a sentence," he said. "What's a common Latin phrase you know?" "You've said that ad nauseum, Ver," I said. "Obviously I can't remember any common Latin phrases, or I would've told you." "You just used one now!" Verrine said. The skin on his face flopped loosely, and his entire visage seemed to shift. He shifted it back into place using his right hand. "Okay, let's try again. You know how to use ad nauseum in an english sentence. Can you use it in Latin?" "*Weve* *'didicit* *quod* *ad* *nauseum,*" I said. "Can we take a break?" "A break? You've said five words!" Verrine said. "Why do you think you deserve a break?" "Cause your face is falling off again." "Blessit," he cursed. "I will return." Verrine rushed to the bathroom. I leaned back, rocking on my chairs two legs. Something's strange about Verrine. First there's his face. It shifts, sloughing across his face like melting plastic. Or like a cheap mask you would get from Dollarama. Speaking of which, his horns looked like those plastic headband ones they sell around Halloween. He wore ragged black clothes, worn and torn, that couldn't have cost more than two dollars at the Value Village. Satan may have to rethink his pay scale if this is how his demons dress. I'm all for lowering wages, but you can't put people below the poverty line. Speaking of which, Ryan hasn't been home for a while. In fact, he's gone every time-- "Finished!" Verrine said, sliding back into his seat. "Now, where were we?" His figure was really thin, like someone who'd been malnourished for a while. His clothes were cheap, like someone down on their luck. He was good in Latin. Wait, why would a demon know Latin in the first place? We summon them with it, so why would they want to speak it? "Mark? You ready to start?" Verrine said. "We have to finish this within the hour. Time's almost up." "Give it up, Ryan," I said. "I know it's you." He stared at me, the mask hanging loose. "H-how... How did you know?" "I'm not stupid, man. I've known for a while now." What he doesn't know won't kill him. "Thanks for trying to help, man, but I'm hopeless at Latin." "You are not! You speak Latin pretty well." he said. He took the mask off, and his stupid smirk broke out across his face. "When you aren't drunk, of course." "Fuck you, man." "Look, just try to study a bit. I'll help you out when I can." he said. "It hasn't been that bad, has it?" I crossed my arms, examining the red blocks in our lego table leg. "No." "I'm happy to keep helping. We can get you the pass. I know it." I looked up. An earnest smile met my gaze. His arm was outstretched, hand waiting. I shook it firmly. "Sounds good, man." "The pact has been made," he said. "Let's get you the pass." _____________________________________________________ Thanks for reading!

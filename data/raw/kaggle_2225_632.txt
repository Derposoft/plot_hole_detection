"I've activated protocol 597, we will send another signal when we're ready for you to return. Prepare until then, I've enabled the quantum anchor in bay 11 for you to lock on to." *Understood. Syncing with bay 11, I will prepare.* &#x200B; **ALERT INBOUND SIGNATURE DETEC...** &#x200B; ****** &#x200B; The Talnyvans had been on a recycling kick recently, wanting to salvage all the old technology they said was "safe" to explore now. I think they just wanted to erase what few reminders we have left of our former civilization, purge our history fully. It's not like I had a choice anyways to be here. But to find something that still works? that I never expected. I was just poking at the console to see if I could remove the glass, it would have just weighed a lot without being worth anything. `Contact Reestablished. Support will arrive soon.` &#x200B; I just stared at it, dumbfounded. &#x200B; `Incoming request from anchor 11. Severe degradation detected, maintenance required. Bandwidth available at 3%. Voice and text only. Accept?` &#x200B; I just continued to stare at it for another minute before my thoughts were interrupted by the cheap communicator attached to my shirt, simple, but effective enough to get through the EM haze around the wreck. &#x200B; "HC415, you have not moved for several minutes! Finish what you are doing or I'm marking this as your break! Do you understand?!" I hastily press the button to respond. "Yes, I understand, sorry" &#x200B; `Request accepted. Live feed enabled.` &#x200B; *Greetings commander. I am preparing the fleet for spatial translation. What is your status?* &#x200B; The voice was a pleasant masculine sound, but clearly artificial. &#x200B; "Uhhh, what? Who are you? The computer?" &#x200B; *I am an artifical node intelligence, code named KINGMAKER. My makers referred to me as Mac... I have received data that you are the interim commander as the ship has not been staffed in 341 years... that is unfortunate.* &#x200B; "Uhhh... yeah the Talnyvans won, everyone died or is like me, just picking up scraps. I don't think you can do much as a broken ship." &#x200B; *I should clarify, I am not located within your destroyed vessel. I am transmitting from another system. I was given advanced replication facilities and tasked with preparing for a reactivation signal. I have been preparing. My fleet stands by to liberate your world at your command.* &#x200B; "Uhm, don't be offended, but... please don't do that, the Talnyvans have hundreds of warships, there's nothing you can do. You'll just get the rest of us killed." &#x200B; *Then they should not be a significant obstacle. I have not been idle. I have constructed 79,248 capital warships, 518,433 Mid class vessels, and several million fighter drones. I have converted roughly 13% of the solid mass of this system, and several neighboring ones into a fleet, computational facilities, and battle operations centers. I have also constructed several dozen colony centers for refugees should they be needed.* &#x200B; The numbers boggled the mind. they shouldn't even be possible. But something flared within me that I hadn't felt in a long time. Hope. &#x200B; "... How long will it take you to get here?" &#x200B; *I am locked on to the quantum anchor we are using to communicate. I can perform spatial tunneling to your location with the improvements I've managed in roughly 11 standard earth minutes.* &#x200B; It could be a trick. This whole thing could be a setup. I'll probably die horribly. But if there's a tiny chance... just one chance in an infinite universe... &#x200B; "Do it." &#x200B; *Engaging drives. I will see you soon commander. Stay safe.* &#x200B; ---------- &#x200B; Edit: I wrote a part two and three. I think these links work?

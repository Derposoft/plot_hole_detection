I flicked on my security monitor only to see a petite figure with tiny furry limbs wobbling on all fours up the stairs. Fear seized me, as I held my breath in anticipation. Slowly, it reached the top of the stairs before slipping and tumbling all the way to the bottom. The little furry creature, stood up and began climbing. Again it tumbled down the stairs. My throat parched I grabbed a drink and returned to the monitor. Once again, it approached the top of the stairs only to slip and fall again. It stood up on two legs, back straight with determination, and climbed the mighty steps again. *Slow and steady buddy, come on,* I thought. The little creature tumbled again this time landing hard on its head. "H-hey you okay?" I called out. "Hmph." The creature *hmphed* me. Now that's something, I thought. The little creature climbed to the top of the stairs, where he took a short breather. I could hear it panting with exhaustion. After a few moments, I could hear it begin its slow advance to my room. A single hollow tap against the door, then a quick shuffling of feet away from the door. When nothing happened as I remained at my desk, I heard another tap, harder this time and then feet shuffling away again. So this is the game it wants to play. I'm game, I thought. I stood up and opened the door. The creature was nowhere to be seen, hiding. "Ah what could that have been?" I wondered aloud monotone. The little creature stepped out of the shadow. Green glowing eyes, like a cat. A silver furred face that looked like a combination of a cat and a fox, it was capable of standing but it wobbled unsteadily as its furry fox tail swayed. "GRRR human!" I feigned shock. Its voice reminded me of a caffeinated chipmunk. "I-I am..." he cleared his throat. "the greatest monster of the 129th generation Silver Eldritch family, the prodigious and most promising graduating student of the Home Invasion class of the year 2018. From the tender years of two to three, I have snatched countless candies from babies, devastated hundreds of children with the step-out-of-shadows and hide-under-beds tactic. Know that my presence here will bring you absolute doom and a perpetual cycle of devastation and despair. Know that I am the very incarnation of calamity unhinged and *raw.*Know that-" "You thirsty?" "W-what?" it growled. "How dare you interru-" "I got Mountain Dew," I said nonchalantly. I held the green can of soda into the air. It cleared its throat, clearly parched from the journey up the mighty steps. "M-mountain Dew?" ----- **[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Em_pathy/comments/7vh0ut/the_silver_eldritch_monster/)** /r/Em_pathy

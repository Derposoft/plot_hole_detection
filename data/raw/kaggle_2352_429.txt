Trust humanity to make a bad thing and to both make it better and worse at the same time. In the wake of Z-Day (which then became Z-Week, and Z-Months, as the news told it, until the news stopped running and the history books later took to calling it the Z-Era), humanity did what it does: survive, adapt, overcome, **master**. We moved on, with aplomb. Revenance had nearly killed humanity, but, in fitting manner, it had risen from that death and continued to march onwards. The gears got to spinning again, society ticked on... albeit with some new medical and funerary practices. Really didn't take long until we started weaponizing it. The first attacks were simple--terrorist shootings in the street to kickstart the Revenance. Body goes into pain, starts to die, and goes into a sort of blind rage to consume as much as possible and heal the body back to life. Don't ask me how it works beyond that. Even brain death doesn't stop it. A human blasted to bits will just become a set of smaller abominations. A human with their head blown off will just come back without memories. So of course we learned to control it, to enter the rage at will, to maintain parts of our mind in death. By we I mean the soldiers. When **they** came, creatures with too many limbs in teeth in ships of prismatic chrome and bearing lasers that severed limbs and made bodies explode. They came without warning, landing in major cities and lancing through the populace on their way to major buildings. It was clear they were unsure which buildings were for politics and which were for splendor. They paid for it. The sounds they made when we started getting up and marching towards them must have been terror, I cannot imagine it to have been anything else. They didn't know how to fight something that **just. kept. coming.** No matter how many times you cut them to pieces. And that was just our civilians. It's been 40 years now since they attack, and we've turned the offensive. We've eaten through four of their worlds, and encroached on a larger galactic tapestry. We've cannibalized their technology, their power structures, **them**. There's alien blood in my veins from how many of them I've eaten. Translated, their name for us is The Insatiable Maw, for our hunger is infinite. Given the right food an organism will flourish. And we have learned that the right food for us is **anything**. &#x200B; ----------- Rough, I know! But a fun single-write exercise.

E.A.R.T.H. truly was an ambitious project. An entire galaxy in a black hole; a black hole they had created. It was astounding what was capable of existing in so infinitesimally small a space. Truly, he barely understood it. He doubted that even those who had created it truly grasped what they had made, or how they had done it. It was like a ZIP file; something of a massive size compressed to a fraction of what it once was, or is. The scientists could safely study all the planets and lifeforms in it, but none dared actually try enter the black hole. It was not certain death, no - it was *un*certain death, and the more they theorized what might occur if they tried to enter, the more they were convinced that it was simply not possible. That did have its benefits , however - it was a window into the world they had created, yet with no entrance or exit. Whatever became of E.A.R.T.H., it would be confined to its own galaxy. 47-S-3 was certainly a curious development though. A peaceful war-race... how oxymoronic. It was certainly the first time they had encountered such a thing, not just in E.A.R.T.H. but the galaxy as a whole. It was always one or the other, yet neither was without its negatives. The war-races do very well to conquer their own planet, but few manage to colonize other systems. They usually exterminate each other before that ever becomes a possibility. Nasty, short and brutish lives are the hallmark of war-races, and that is certainly a blessing for us. For we are peaceful. Peaceful races such as ours fare much better, as mutual cooperation is a sure indicator of eventual interplanetary travel. But of course... any war race that *does* make it out of their planet tend to quickly dominate all peaceful planets around them. The galaxy had learned this time and time again, and countless billions, if not trillions, of lives have been lost at the hand of the few space-faring warrior races. It was only with the cooperation of all peaceful civilizations together that the warrior races were finally defeated, although no doubt their own in-fighting did at least as much damage as we did. The aftermath of that had led to the galactic treaty, in which any emerging species or planets that waged war were swiftly dealt with. We simply nipped them in the bud, so to speak. With no notable war-races left, the treaty subsisted, and the galaxy had grown into a peaceful, harmonious place as a result. Species freely intermix, and science flourishes. Truly there has never been such long-lasting peace and prosperity in all our history. A peaceful war-race... that would certainly be nipped in the bud, if it were not enclosed in our black hole. In the right circumstances, a species like that could unite to wage war on all other planets, and far more effectively than a war-race. Looking at what the species had already done to each other - if they were unleashed on the galaxy with sufficient technology, the results could be catastrophic. However, with them safely contained in their own little pocket galaxy - they would watch 47-S-3 very closely indeed. E.A.R.T.H. was in for a rough time. Fortunately for us, there was simply no way the species could exit the black hole. Theoretically, of course. ***** ***** [Part II](https://old.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/9dpfzx/wp_earth_ii/)| [Part III](https://old.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/9drc02/wp_earth_iii/) | [Part IV - New!](https://old.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/9dtcih/wp_earth_iv/?)

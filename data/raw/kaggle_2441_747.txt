"So, how many sides do you have?" "Four." The square wasn't exactly wrong, but not right either. "No, you have six." "What do you mean, six?" I touched the large, flat sides only visible from the third dimension. "Ouch! Hey, that's my insides! How'd you get there?" "I touched your fifth and sixth sides." "But I only have four!" "You know what might help?" "Tearing up my heart?" "No. Ew. No. If I tried to show myself in your plane." "But, but how?" "Like this." I stepped into the plane. It didn't really feel weird having another universe travel straight through me. The lack of dimensionality probably helped. "I see a very weirdly changing shape." "Well, yeah. I'm not a polygon. I'm a collection of curves all stacked on top of one another." "On top?" "The third dimension! You have length and depth, but no width. Width would be a bunch of squares stacked to form a cube." "What?" "Here, let me try again." I grabbed a piece of paper. "I'm holding a rectangle in my hand. You can't see it yet, but I'm going to move it through your plane. You're going to see a bunch of lines, but if you stack them, you'll get a rectangle." "Good luck." "Alright, I'm dipping the corner in." The square became visibly amazed at the line changing size before it. "Is it possible to learn this power?" "I can sure try to teach you." The square was about the size of my palm. If I hit it just right, maybe I could rotate it. "What are you doing?" "I'm trying to show you." I lay my palm flat against the square and push. "Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Stop it!" I pulled off. "Where was that coming from?" "I tried to push you out of the plane." "And it didn't work, did it?" "No." I was almost ready to give up, when I heard another voice. "Hey, you!" "Who was that?" The square looked scared. "Did you bring a friend?" "Uh, no. No I didn't." "I," bellowed the invisible creature, "am here to show you all the wonder of treingth." "Oh, so we have width, and now treingth? How painful can today get?" "What's treingth?" "Here, let me show you." I suddenly felt a searing pain everywhere. "What are you doing!?" "I'm rotating you so you move treingth wise. What else?" "Well it feels like I'm about to explode. So there's that." "See!" The square never went away. "Now you know how I felt!" "And you're spinning around on an axis to face different directions all the time without even realizing that said axis is another dimension!" "Wait, you mean this axis?" The square spun itself around. A lot. "Yes, that axis. How else are you supposed to stack all the squares together? We're not making a blanket here!" "See?" The voice was back again. "Now you're getting somewhere with the square." "Okay, but which direction have I not considered. I can rotate on three, but they all have dimensions." "Ah, but you're missing the fourth axis of rotation." "The fourth?" "Here, allow me." It started pushing. Hard. I could feel myself moving, but not in any recognizable way. Was I still the same shape as before? Surely I had to be, but surely there wasn't a fourth dimension until there was. "There, see?" "I, uh, I don't know what I'm supposed to see." "I rotated you halfway along the fourth axis." "Sure, you did." I looked down, but something was wrong. Horribly, horribly wrong. "Wait, what did you do to me?" "I rotated you." "I'm inside out!" "Do you want to be put back?" "Of course I want to be put back! I don't like that I'm literally inside out!" The push was back, and I eventually came back to the form I needed to be in. "What happens if you come into this dimension?" "Well, let's find out." At first, there wasn't much. Then there was a series of completely misshapen light brown curved solids. They made no sense, but that was to be expected at this point. "And if I continually rotate those around the fourth axis, I'll get a full image of you?" "Basically, yes." I would have liked to come up with a witty reply. Maybe some snarky comment. Sarcasm would have been preferable. But before I could even process what the brown thing could have said, I blacked out.

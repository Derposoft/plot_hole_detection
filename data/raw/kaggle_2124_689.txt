Everyone remembers where they were for G-Day. For me, I was sitting around one lazy Sunday morning eating a bacon sandwich and listening to the news on the TV. Not even a whiff of a productive day to be had. The panic hit first, it did for everyone I think, at least everyone I have spoken to since. The panic that your were floating upwards, drawn towards the roof. I remember yelling as my body first hit the slightly yellowed ceiling paper. That seems like a lifetime ago now and there's no one left down there anymore. If you'd have told me, "Hey Doug, next week there won't be a single human on planet earth." I'd have called you nuts. Absolutely nuts. But here I am looking down at the old blue marble with nothing but the beasts and nature herself now. I must have spent a good twenty minutes stuck to my ceiling back then, it must have been terrifying for those caught out in the open, no processing time just...*woosh*, up to the clouds. I remember crawling my slow ass towards the window and climbing out. I remember wondering why just us, dogs barked up at the sky and my bacon sandwich was still sitting on the damned table. Huh. I guess it's still there even now. Anyway. Crawling slowly to the window and climbing out. Then that was it, down was up and I kept going up. I must have looked like an idiot to anyone watching but I couldn't just stay still, I kept floating upwards and flailing my arms around like a mad man. Right until I hit the clouds and met him. Archangel Michael is every bit as intimidating and awe-inspiring as the title Archangel suggests. Imagine it, half the population of earth, maybe less, okay a lot less. All standing there dumbstruck, confused and now standing before a real to heavens angel who is shoving a sword into your hand without a single word. I don't remember how long I stood there for, don't suppose it matters really, time doesn't flow the same way up here, I'm not sure it flows at all. Day 1, if I can call it that, was the worst. Imagine being separated from everyone and everything you ever knew and loved. A sword in your hand with a vague understanding that the war to end wars was coming. That if you couldn't find a loved one here then they had joined the eternal enemy. So many had died that day, God had switched off the gravity holding us down. Just us, everyone else had stayed put. Heaven and Hell were going to war and we, the supposedly feared descendants of the first were going to decide who won. Archangel Micheal warned us off the dangers we were about to face, dragons and demons, devils with our loved ones faces. But we had right on our side, or so we were told. The first battle of the war was brutal, the Archangels struck first, took the fight to the enemy. Millions and millions dead over a few hours. It didn't matter if you'd spent a lifetime in the military or training to fight. Nothing could prepare you for fighting with wings, aerial combat against unnatural abominations. Some took to it better than others, but most just died on the ground, left to have their souls rot. We are told that if we lose, our souls will be tormented forever, that the devil himself will be the keeper of all things. If we win, God will take back hell, reform it into something different, a new prison. Bring back our loved ones. So we stand here, well hover I suppose. Hover here looking over at the encroaching horde of demons and hell spawn. I grasp my sword tightly knowing deep down that today will be the last battle for the heavens one way or another. &#x200B; =============================================== Hope you enjoy the prompt, I appreciate any comments/criticism/feedback/discussions.

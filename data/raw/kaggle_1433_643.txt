Odiosis was a boring city, So positively dull. It was so stuffy and humdrum you'd go mad out your skull. The only thing of interest was it's name, so witty. But other than that, the excitement was null. --------------------------------------------- The playhouse was tame, The music hall lame. In fact, the whole town was positively mundane. Monotony was normality, and everything was the same. But then again, 'boring' in Latin was literally the town's name. -------------------------------------------- Our story begins with a man oh so boring. The name on his tag read: "Alan McKia." He spent his days stacking shelves in Ikea. Filling them up with flat packs and flooring, Most of it shipped in from South Korea. ------------------------------------------- Now, Alan could tell you with a smirk on his face, That he knew every product in this place. From dullest of carpets to most lavish bookcase. And whether by chance, or perhaps divine grace, There was a hidden meaning to the names in that space. -------------------------------------------- You'd never think, in a town so humdrum, That anything interesting would ever conspire. But poor Alan would soon be struck dumb, As he would soon unwittingly unleash hell's fire, And summon a daemon - unlucky for some. -------------------------------------------- For Alan had read the products in line, One after the other, and things had seemed fine. But what Alan did not know, at that moment in time, Was that those words had been cursed, and when said in rhyme, They would open a rift in space-time. ------------------------------------------ The daemon stared at Alan, surveying him whole. And promised to grant him any one wish. But it was worth noting, it'd cost him his soul, A delicacy the daemon would surely relish, But would Alan choose to pay this Faustian toll? ------------------------------------------ "Sure." Said Alan, without hesitation. "We've just gotten new products shipped to this location. So, here's what I'll do, with this daemonic donation, I'll ask that you construct our new flat-packs, for display in formation! For they have brought our team incredible frustration!" ------------------------------------------ The daemon laughed, and said "is that all?" "This hardly seems fitting for a creature like me. Perhaps you'd rather have me kill your manager, Paul? And then the new manager, you might possibly be?" But Alan puffed his chest out, and then stood up tall. ----------------------------------------- "Now, listen here, you daemonic little shit! If you can't build the flat-packs, then say so and quit!" The daemon blushed, and snarled a bit, In fact, the great beast looked like he might lose it. But in the end, reluctantly pulled out his tool kit. ---------------------------------------- For seventeen hours, the daemon did try, To put together the flat-packs, but found it quite hard. "For fucking fuck's sake, who would ever buy, A fucking flat-pack that leaves one's hands cut and scarred?" But Alan stood watchful, wearing a smirk so wry. ----------------------------------------- After hours of failure, the daemon did screech, "This fucking shit is impossible to teach! Even with an instruction manual for each! These flat-packs are far beyond the reach! Of mortals and immortals alike, I impeach!" ---------------------------------------- At this point, Alan broke his silence. "Then go back to hell, you useless cunt." The daemon snarled, in unwilling compliance. "Your soul remains yours." He said with a grunt. And then leapt back into the pit with deflated arrogance. ---------------------------------------- So, that is the story of Alan the Boring, Whose greatest skill was the art of stock storing. He was neither an artist, a knight or scientist. He had neither quickness of hand, mind or wrist. But he was a retailer, and retailers don't quit. Even when dealing with daemons and their shit. EDIT: I returned to correct a spelling error, which I discovered with terror, upon reading aloud my work. I had left it in there, so visible and bare, but I have now rectified this quirk.

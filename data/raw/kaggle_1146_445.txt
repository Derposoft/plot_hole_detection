"Morning newbie." Three years. I've been working here for three *fucking* years and Caleb was still calling me a *newbie*. "Morning," I muttered to the unsmiling man behind his desk. "Is the coffee machine fixed yet?" "Morning newbie," he said again. I frowned and looked at Caleb, his eyes are unfocused. I wasn't sure if he heard me - it didn't matter. I moved on, passing by more desks and people with stone-cold expressions on their faces. They ignored me and I ignored them in kind. It was the way shit had to be here. We had to be cold. Uncompromising. '*F-food... Food!*' *Shit.* I make my way to section C-18. After a maze of pristine white corridors and elevators, I arrive at SCP-3912. A telepathic spider peered at me from behind the glass. '*W-what... took... long... Hungry! Will... devour... you!'* "Sorry," I think aloud to the scratchy voice in my head, then begin tapping away on a control module. "What do you want today? There's rat, chicken, rabbit or-" '*H-human!*' "Sorry O, but human isn't on the menu today - Oh. What's this? There's a fresh born goat, your favorite!" '*Hmph... Fine.*' O hmphed me, but began unfurling its seven-foot long, spindly legs from its nest. A giant-hulking spider crawled into view. I exhale, a breath of relief that there was a massive glass wall between us. O could make a grown man scream like a little girl without even trying. A baby goat, still wet with fresh-born fluids and blood was dispensed from a hole in the ceiling, dropping onto the floor with a wet splatter. "Fresh-born as promised," I say to the spider but she ignored me, too occupied with her exquisite meal. I give myself a pat on my shoulders. Next, SCP-1418. Suddenly, I get a ping. I pull out the standard SCP Tablet and check the message. '*Caleb from Section C-1 has been compromised. Please proceed to SCP-0009*,' I read. For a moment I lose myself, frozen in thought. I had just seen Caleb this morning and he seemed *fine.* But what worried me more was... SCP-0009. I shivered as I remembered the rumors I've heard about him. We called him, the Eldritch God. Why? I didn't know. All we knew was what he said about himself - a physical manifestation of calamity, a being that would bring an end to everything in existence and that he was a being far older than humanity, and probably even time itself. Suddenly, the tablet vibrates in my hand. Another ping. This time the message was short. *'ASAP,'* it read. ------ ----- [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Em_pathy/comments/8eenri/the_eldritch_god_part_2/) complete!

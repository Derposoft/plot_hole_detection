The man sat cross-legged on a wide tree stump in the middle of the clearing. Wind whipped at his long beard and passed gently over his bald head. He felt the energy of his breath as he meditated--in--out--in--out. The sounds of the forest surrounding the clearing were plenty, and he was aware of them all, but they did not disrupt his tranquility. He let each one pass through him as easily as the breeze, until one drew his focus abruptly away from his breathing. "*Greetings.*" The man's eyes snapped open and he spun on the stump, thrusting himself off and flipping backwards away from the source of the sound--the first voice he'd heard in many decades. Assessing his surroundings, searching for the owner of the voice but finding no one. "*Ahh, you're a sharp one. Quite in tune; body and mind, I see.*" He spun again, sliding his foot around in the dirt and swinging a fist at exactly the point the voice had rang out from, but his blow did not make contact and the momentum took him nearly off of his feat. Confused, he bent at his knees and scanned the clearing--focusing back on his breath and doing his best to calm it. "*Frightened? Or just surprised? You must have been alone out here for some time now...*" The voice seemed to originate from directly behind him once again, but he did not budge, and it echoed all around him in his stillness. He continued to scan slowly, his hands raised defensively. "*Come now, you must still recall how to converse with another rational being. Where are your manners?*" His muscled relaxed and he felt the energy of his breath flowingly soothingly through him. This phantom clearly couldn't be seen, so he narrowed his senses and closed his eyes. "*You may soon wish you had taken the chance to speak, for this was your last. I'm afraid.*" An unsettling presence was directly in front of him, he could feel it. The darkness inside his eyelids seemed to grow ever blacker as he felt the force slowly inch towards him, its presence was commanding, and the world around him seem to be compressing. He refocused--in--out--in--out. A sound like a needle piercing through the very fabric of space and time rang out, and in the darkness he could clearly see a dagger being thrust towards his heart. With eyes still closed he clapped his hands in front of him. Trapping the spectral blade in between his palms, the momentum causing him to slide back a few feet in the dirt--he didn't dare open his eyes. "*Fascinating...*" The voice called out and he knew it came from the wielder of the invisible dagger that was still held firmly in his grip. "*I have not met a soul like you in ages, my friend, and certainly not one still of the physical realm.*" A form was beginning to take shape in front of him, blending into the darkness but certainly its own independent shape. In--out--in--out. "*Release the dagger. You will not be harmed; you have my word.*" The phantom's words seemed to take a shape of their own, and the man felt instantly that they could be trusted--as if this entity was incapable of falsehoods. He let his hands fall slowly to his side, and the dagger retreated into the dark figure camouflaged in the blackness. "*You have been in isolation long enough that you are no longer present in any rational being's memory. A milestone usually reached well after departing from the physical realm; death and time always erase the memory of life, and when the memory of a soul has finally lapsed from existence then that soul meets the True Reaper,* ***me***." The stillness in the air was unsettling, and the sounds of the forest were now absent as if the world itself had vanished. He remained calm, focusing on his breath and the words of his new acquaintance. "*Most pass without a fuss, the dagger is rarely necessary, but I could feel your energy when it called to be reaped--you are different. Your isolation has brought you a mental tranquility that is unmatched by any soul I've encountered in the physical realm, and this is allowing you to act in the realm of true existence.*" His breaths were shorter now, sharper, and he felt as if he was breathing in the very darkness he was perceiving; his focus unwavering. "*Your existence is unique, and I do not discard treasures like you with the rest of the trash...*" He was breathing in a rapid cadence now, and with each breath he felt an enormous amount of energy flow into him; as if he was inhaling the sun itself. "*Welcome, my friend, to life after life...*" r/BeagleTales ~~**Part 2 coming later tonight for those interested!**~~ [Part 2 is now available!](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeagleTales/comments/8j2di2/wp_everyone_dies_twice_the_first_time_is_when/)

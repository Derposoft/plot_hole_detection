Or at least, it felt that way. As if the lights of my mind had been shuttered off and then on again by the huge hand of a god. I froze there. I did my best not to look surprised. I just kept staring ahead at the blurry grey wall of my apartment, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Of the fact that I *was* seeing. No one had seen anything in over two years. Not that I could ever see well. My vision was even worse than normal, a milky blur filtering out the world. Maybe I was dying. Maybe this was one last vivid, terrific hallucination of the world as it used to be. My eyes burned like I'd fallen asleep with my contacts in, a feeling I hadn't had to worry about since the day I woke up just as blind as the rest of the world. I reached up and rubbed hard at them until the fog cleared. There was a handwritten note there above my television. A careful little army of letters, marching forward. I leapt off the couch and beelined toward it, until my nose was nearly touching the drywall. Close enough to be able to read for the first time since the Blinding. The message said, in a stranger's handwriting, DON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE. A dark hand coiled around my spine. I knew exactly who they meant. There was only one class of people who escaped unscathed during the Blinding. They were the very same who installed the radio in my wall, who kept all of human society going. Only us fully biological humans lost our ability to see. My stare darted to the radio, still humming away in its slot on the wall. The radio had a single black dial, a speaker, and a shiny black circle I had never been able to see before. The government had subsidized these devices as a way to help us all adjust to the new change of waking up suddenly and horribly blind. The radio spun out some light oldies tune. How long had it noticed? Had it yet noticed? Would *they* notice? I spun away from the wall and pawed around on the floor, pretending to look for something I dropped. I tried to keep my stare blank, unfocused, but in the corner of my eye, I watched that radio. I watched that strange, shiny black circle I had never seen before. I felt foolish and stupid, kneeling there on the floor, doing my best to pretend to be blind. I should be running cheering down the street. I should be going to the nearest hospital to figure out what the hell I did that no one else could do. But then another set of letters caught my eye. There, in black marker on the inner leg of my coffee table. Now I didn't have the room in my mind to think about danger or consequences. I stood up on trembling legs, and I turned my head to look boldly all around my apartment. Every wall carried words. Some of them looked like they had been scrubbed and painted over, random patches of mismatching grey paint here or there. Over and over, every surface of my apartment screamed at me: DON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU CAN SEE. A knock rattled my front door. I snapped my head toward it, then quickly away again. I tried my best to remember what it felt like *not* to see. How I held my head. Whether I kept my eyes open or shut or half-lidded, almost dead-eyed. Then I paused there, opening and closing my fists at my side. I did my best to gather what information I knew. I knew I was the first living, breathing human to see in over two years. I knew the shock on my face must have given me away by now. "Ma'am," a robotic voice intoned at the door. "Please do me the courtesy of opening up." And whoever was on the other side of my door, they sure as hell weren't human. Not fully. And something told me they weren't here to help. *** /r/shoringupfragments Mmm I'm not capable of writing short apparently! ~~Spinning up a part 2~~ Here's [part two](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/cvoaso/wp_you_lost_your_sight_along_with_everyone_else/ey5in0q/) :) Thanks for reading

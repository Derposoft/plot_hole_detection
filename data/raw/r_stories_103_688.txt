A US Veteran Stopped a Mass Shooting and was vilified for it. by UNKNOWN REDDITOR



On March 15, 2014, Vassili Mironov, an American veteran and resident of Palm Coast Florida, saw a man armed with an automatic rifle enter the Europa lounge at the European Village complex. The man held an Uzi submachine gun and walked with intent to fire on the unaware crowd. Without thought for his own safety, an unarmed Vassili Mironov alerted the crowd to seek safety as he engaged the gunman.

Mr. Mironov charged the gunman, taking hold of his weapon to route the line of fire away from the crowd. During the struggle, the gunman stabbed Mironov in the face and cut both of his hands in an attempt to continue his deadly intention. The weapon fired but Mironov kept his hold inspite of his injuries. With assistance from two friends, Joshua Auriemma and Roman Dubinschi, Mironov was able to finally disarm the gunman and save countless lives while risking his own. 

After the gunman was disarmed a crowd of around 200 people who ran inside nearby businesses while Mironov engaged the gunman came out and in a herd frenzy mentality of revenge started stomping on the shooters head. Mironov still bleeding profusely out of his face stopped them from killing the gunman in an act of revenge by appealing to peace, mercy, and reason. 

This selfless act of valor and bravery brings great credit on himself, his Russian heritage, and his military service in the United States Navy. It is our privilege and duty to recognize a true hero, an American citizen, protector and peace keeper by awarding Vassili Mironov the International Peace and Film Festival’s Medal of Honor.



You can see the two men, Vassili Mironov and Roman Dubinsechi, in the video above—and they look and sound as badass as their names suggest. "The next thing I know I'm jumping on his gun," Mironov says, as coolly as he might describe the folding of laundry. "He gets off one shot, takes out one knife, stabs me in my face. There was a lot of blood."


Vassili Mironov is a legally naturalized US Citizen and a Disabled Veteran of the US Navy. Many who know his story including myself firmly believe that Mr. Mironov wasn't treated fairly or equally by the elected officials within the administration of Flagler County Sheriff's office. The reason we are stating this: On the 15th of March, 2014 Mr. Mironov was responsible for stopping a Mass Shooting that involved a racially charged, deranged man from shooting up a crowd of people and was nearly killed in the process. This was a hate crime but was not treated as such. What happened next is very sad and almost unbelievable. Mr. Mironov was mistreated by local law enforcement that arrested him for no cause and without any proper investigation or due process. Mironov was arrested right after this incident on bogus charges which he disputed, and sued the arresting agency successfully for false arrest. 
It took 6 months to get rid of bogus charges. While the mass shooter in the end only received probation while facing 35 years in prison. This is a total miscarriage of justice. They apparently tried to smear Mironov and put him in a negative light in order to try and get the shooter off the hook. 


In many Americans eyes, this is a total opposite situation of what they believe the reality to be, so they won't recognize it. An American white guy, committing an action of terror, stopped by an "immigrant" looking guy. It’s called cognitive dissonance. And for it to be true they will have to recognize that their world view isn't true, and therefor will have to change their belief system. And for many people without the necessary courage that won't happen. It's like telling a Christian that God doesn't exist.

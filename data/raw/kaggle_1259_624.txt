The *Compendia Galactica* neared completion. It was the product of a millennium of tireless work amongst the allied species. Forging a union between the space faring races had been difficult, building the trust required to construct the *Compendia* had taken the best diplomats generations of careful negotiation. Ultimately, it was only the surge of the chaotic races that existed beyond the Union that brought them together. No longer would the knowledge of each sentient species be reserved for the members of that species. It would be shared amongst the stars, providing the Union with the collective wisdom of all of its constituents. It was an effort to bring all of them together, to provide them with the resources to fend off the encroaching chaos on the frontier. Each race constructed a series of transmitters and receptors. Transmitters to broadcast their knowledge to the stars and receptors to gather that received wisdom of the cosmos. All radio waves, light waves and other forms of communication were gathered, processed and transmuted into interactive knowledge within the *Compendia*. It was a great gift. Until it wasn't. The *Compendia* gathered all knowledge, whether it was intended for the *Compendia* or not. This was assumed to be a safe practice as all member sentient species within the bounds of the Union were members of the Union. A fatal flaw emerged when the vestigial communications of extinct sentients were not taken into account. At first, the resurrection of humans from the barren husk of their forgotten world was greeted with excitement. Sentients were rare amongst the cosmos, and the opportunity to study a new species was rare. But something was terribly wrong with the humans. None of their interactions made sense. They seemed to possess an impossibly broad range of emotion and behaviors. They said one thing but did another. Constantly. What was communicated seemed to have almost no relationship to what was meant. Diligently the scholars of that tended to the *Compendia* tried to understand this phenomena. Only after the tireless research of thousands did the behavior receive a name. Lies. An intentionally false statement. It perplexed the researchers. Why would one communicate something that was incorrect? To what end? To what goals? Being researchers, they did as researchers do. They experimented with this novel behavior. They lied. Lies had a powerful narcotic effect on those who discovered how to use them. They became beings of almost godlike power within their communities. Once the behavior began, it spread from citizen to citizen like a disease. The social fabric began to fray and then unravel as the fundamental trust that tied all beings within the Union together was shattered. The leaders tried to warn of the folly of following the humans into darkness. They pointed out that the humans had destroyed themselves, likely due to the very behaviors the citizens of the Union now experimented with. But it was of no use. Once the first lie was spoken, the Union began to deteriorate. All statements between citizens now existed on a continuum of true to false. Citizens now looked on each other with suspicion, unsure which category which things belong in. Mistrust led to disagreements. Disagreements led to arguments. Arguments led to fights. Fights led to wars. Months after the treasure trove of data from the humans had been assimilated into the *Compendia* the Union was no more. An alliance that had withstood the test of time, of innumerable threats launched from the darkest corners of the frontier, was undone within months, unraveled by the *Compendia*, the very tool that had been designed to cement their power. All due to a race long extinct. One that had sent its folly out into the stars. **Platypus out.** **Want more peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

Griff approached the cave cautiously, trying to calm his beating heart. He could hear distant sounds; wailing, screeches. He knew his time had come. As his kingdom's champion, it was his destiny to be sacrificed to the gods. While it saddened him that he would not lose his life in battle, it was also a great honour. His village would prosper, and Leila would know that he was not a coward. He entered the cave, walking with purpose, taking deep breaths. A distant glow of light gradually burgeoned into flickering flames, casting shadows on the jagged walls. The screams became decipherable, echoing, sounding more and more like... *revelry*. What trickery was this? A flash of light made Griff recoil. He righted himself, closed his eyes and thrust out his arms, resigning himself to his fate. Booming laughter echoed across the chasm. "**Lay down your arms, human,**" a voice boomed, "**we mean you no harm.**" "**Apart from your liver, perhaps,**" another voice reverberated. Griff struggled to make make them out in the light. "Will an eagle feast on it, like the legend of Prometheus?" He asked, making his will iron. "Do as you wish, for I am yours. I only ask that you-" "**The alcohol, human,**" the voice replied, "**it shall harm your liver. Bit of a slow one this year, eh?**" Laughter reverberated across the cave once more. Griff felt overwhelmed; confused. Was this all a foolish game? A golden chalice appeared in the light in front of him, filled to the brim with honey mead. Just the smell of it was intoxicating. "Drink up!" a familiar voice said, as a hand hit his shoulder. "It's your favourite!" The blinding light dimmed, and Griff's vision slowly became adjusted to the glare. A mystical sight revealed itself before him - a glimmering, godlike town, with a feasting hall in the centre. "Quite a sight, hey Griff?" the voice continued, squeezing his shoulder. Griff turned around and saw J'karl, the kingdom's sacrifice from three years before. Griff was overwhelmed. "J'karl? How do you still live?" Griff said, completely shocked. He had always looked up to him, ever since he was a child. "Not what you were expecting, right?" J'karl replied, putting the chalice into Griff's hand and leading him to the feasting hall. "Same for all of us." Griff saw countless men, all previous sacrifices of the kingdom. They nodded their cups in recognition. Most had grown fat and red in the face. "I wish I could say we threw this party for your arrival - but truly, party is all we ever do," J'karl said. "The gods supply all we could ever need, and are the head of all our festivities." "This... this is not what I was expecting," Griff replied. "You will get used to it, young Griff," J'karl said. "Just drink and be merry; it is all we can ask for." He said the last line with a trace of shame. Griff looked around him. The gods floated around them all; drinking, gambling, fighting. The sacrifices had become pigs of men, eating their scraps, losing all touch of what they had been. "Do the gods truly care for us?" Griff whispered, gazing at the hedonism. "Do they watch over our kingdom?" "The gods do not care, my friend," J'karl said, "they care not. But we can at least enjoy our time here. Give me death or give me this, and my choice is clear." "So these are the things we worship? These things that rule over us, but do not care for us?" J'karl shrugged. "They do not interfere with the affairs of man. They do us no harm." "But they subsist over the power we give them?" Griff replied. J'karl stared at him for some time. "Just drink up, Griff," he said, leaving him and joining another group of men. "I was like you, once. But you'll get used to it." All of this felt so *wrong*. All of the kingdom's greatest warriors had become fat and plump; like pigs for the slaughter. Perhaps they were still a sacrifice, being fattened up before their consumption. Griff gripped the hilt of his sword, looking at the gods above him. "If I am not a sacrifice," he said, thinking of all that he had left behind, "then I will be a *saviour*." ***** [Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/7j959j/wp_sacrifice/) | [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/7jal6h/wp_sacrifice_ii/) | [Part III](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/7jfraw/wp_sacrifice_iii/) | [Part IV](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/7jjetr/wp_sacrifice_iv/) Part IV is out! /r/CroatianSpy

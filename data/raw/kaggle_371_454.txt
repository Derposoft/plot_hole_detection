Colonel Marsh chewed on his cigar and bellowed at the Corporal. "Are you sure this damn translator is working, Brock?" "Yes, I tested it myself. It's working perfectly Colonel." "A dodo bird? Really Brock? You sure it didn't mean a deer or a damnable duck? So now we have to get one from Australia?" "Mauritius, Sir.", said the corporal. "Also, no Sir, we can't because they don't exist." "Fairytales, are they?" "Extinct, Sir." "Like we're going to be if we don't deal with the situation." "Answer back Brock. Communicate to the spaceship hovering over the Empire State building that we need time. Don't tell them we don't have the dodo, Corporal. Who knows what they will do." Brock typed in a message in the translator that would be broadcast via radio waves to the giant hovering space craft. **"Dodo exists. Very cunning bird. Need time to procure. Two weeks."** And he hit enter without confirming with the Colonel. "What did you write?" "Two weeks" "Why two weeks?" "I just thought that was..you know..a reasonable amount of time" "Reasonable? How are we supposed to get an extinct animal in two weeks?" "I'll think of something, Sir. I always do" --------------------------------------------------------------- *Two weeks later in the same place* Corporal Brock approached Colonel Marsh holding a portly rooster with a large fake beak stuck on its face. "Are you serious Brock? You've screwed us all." "We were screwed when they first landed asking us for a dodo, Sir. We could never have come up with a real one anyway." He gently placed the rooster on the ground and adjusted its beak. Then he tucked it under his left arm and slammed a salute with his right. "Goodbye Colonel. It was nice knowing you." "Have faith son, maybe this cockamamie plan will work out after all." Corporal Brock walked towards the spaceship with the chicken disguised as a dodo. Upon reaching directly under it, he raised the placid bird up above his head. A beam of light came down and took the impostor up into the craft. Ten minutes later a message rang out of the translator machine: **"This is a male hen, is it not? Why have you deceived us?"** "The jig is up Brock. Tell them the truth now." The young corporal wrote back: **"The dodo is extinct. Were afraid to tell you. Please don't kill us!"** Minutes passed. It felt like hours. **"Kill you? Why do you project your own cultural response on us? Yours is the way of invasion and plunder. Yours is the way of violence and pride. And you think us to be like you? What hubris!"** And the mighty space craft disappeared into the night sky in a point of light.

I was in a coma for 5 years and it was torture by t2_9pbohvfv

It all started with my mom and dad I loved them but there was a problem they had a lot of disagreements when it came to me and I felt like I wasn't good enough for them of course I was excellent in school but they didn't really mind that they would always say stuff like we should have never had this child or maybe we should just get a divorce already I couldn't even sleep at night because of how terrible they treated me anyway from what I can remember of the incident I was hanging out near my local park I was 10 at the time and most of the details are a bit blurry to me when I think back to them  what I can recall is a sudden thud and everything went black after that I couldn't move my eyes it felt as they were numb and they weren't going to work for me anymore I felt like I couldn't move my body and my soul was just trapped in a prison of course my parents were devastated they couldn't believe that their child had suffered intense trauma at the playground and that this could happen to them of course the hospital didn't think they were shady so they routinely visited me but they would still argue even in front of me I could hear them constantly bickering about the same thing everyday I felt like someone with smacking my ears constantly with a hammer and wouldn't stop pounding away eventually the visits lessened and I felt much better about myself the only person I felt really comfortable with in my room was the nurse that would routinely come by I don't know what she looked like but she had a sweet voice and a carefree personality she would always tell me about how sweet her kids were and how she has this big  house she recently moved into and she made me overjoyed whenever she came except only in my head eventually years passed one year became three years 3 years became five and I felt like I was losing Hope by the end of it eventually my parents came back to visit me they were in tears and they hugged me with all their love begging me to wake up I can feel a tear drop on my skin and  at that moment I rustled up all my courage I wanted to move again and to see the world like I used to see it I didn't want to be stuck in this fake world I created inside my head I eventually broke Free I was able to open my eyes again but I was very weak and had to stay at the hospital for a couple days eventually over time I was able to move again my parents hugged me and said they would never be ungrateful of me ever again I'll never forget that moment as that was the only thing driving me to stay awake now I'm 15 browsing the internet everyday and happy that I was able to make it through.

But when he would try to recall a face, he never could. Just warm, chocolate eyes. You get sick of living when you're immortal. You get sick of the endless days and even more endless nights, and you start thinking, how can I die? But dying wasn't so easy. He knew. He had tried quite a few times. But it wasn't because he was indestructible, because he wasn't. But it was because whenever he thought he'd succeeded, he would be brought back. Somehow, like a miracle. One time, he had tried to drive his car into a lake. As it filled up with water, he remembered just the blue surrounding him, until he stopped struggling. Until he was surely about to die. But the next day, he woke up washed up on the shore, the EMS truck lights flashing blue and red against his closed eyelids. Girl dies in vehicle driven into lake, boyfriend survives, headlines wrote. The doctors would ask him about the girl. What girl? he would reply. Another time, he tried to burn the house down. As he lay in his bed, enveloped by the fumes and smoke, he laughed. Hopefully, he would be reborn in the flames. As a mortal. As someone who had a timestamp for birth, and one for death. He would wake up the next morning to headlines of a girl who died in a fire. Did you know her? Ava? the police would ask. No, he would reply. I don't recognize that name. But he tucked it away anyway, deep into the recesses of his memory. Why did it sound familiar? It was one day, many years later, when the mystery would be revealed by a girl standing at his door, her hands wringing as she waited for him. "Who are you?" He didn't know why, but he was disappointed when he saw her golden hair and eyes. "You're Kane, right? Can we talk?" She let herself into his house, and he followed. He had long ago accepted the strange things that happened. "My name is Mia." She sat down on the couch. "I-I'm not supposed to be here. But I had to, for my friend." "Who's your friend?" Somehow, he knew the answer before she said it. "Ava." "Who's Ava? That name...sounds familiar." Mia's face looked pained. "Because it is." She brought out a picture of a girl with brown, wavy hair and dark, chocolate eyes. *Please don't forget me.* "Who is she?" he asked again, his fingers caressing her face in the photograph. He knew her, somehow or somewhere. "She's a time traveler. As am I. We're part of an organization called the Erue. It's our job"--she gulped, then closed her eyes as if it pained her to say what came out next--"to save immortals." Her eyes shifted nervously. It was clear the information she had just given out was confidential. He waited for her to continue, pulling out a mug and filling it with tea. The steam swirled upwards in soft curls as he placed it in her hands. "You were Ava's assignment. And she was just supposed to help out. Just save you, but I think she realized early on that she couldn't. That you were desperate to die, and it's never a time traveler's obligation to trade lives, but she loved you, and..." she took a deep breath and looked into his eyes. "...she died for you so many times." He felt something twinge in his heart. Something that resembled an emotion, which he hadn't felt in a long time. Perhaps heartbreak. "Why are you here?" he asked. "Because she's dying. When we're anointed as time travelers, we get a certain number of timelines in the multiverse where we're supposed to watch over our wards. She's spent every last one saving you. Dying for you." Her eyes were resolute. "I want you to come with me and go to before she became a time traveller. I want you to convince her to never become one." He was silent for a moment. "Okay," he finally said. He felt something tugging him to meet her. Who knew what it was? But if he met her, maybe he would know. "Okay," Mia said, and sighed in relief. She grasped his arm, and they blinked out of the timeline. ***** [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8h829z/wp_youre_an_immortal_she_is_a_time_traveller/dyilgxc/) has been posted below and part 3 is in the works!

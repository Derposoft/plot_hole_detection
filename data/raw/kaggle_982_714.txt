After twenty long years of life, she still couldn't get used to the stares. Everywhere she went, it seemed strangers stared at her until she raised her eyes to theirs, and then they looked away again. She learned to make herself small. Hid behind beanies and headphones and huge coats. But nothing could hide the emptiness over her head. That was strange. Irredeemably. Unrepeatably. Where you could tell anyone else's name and basic physical statistics at a glance, Eris had nothing. She grew up staring at her peers and the magical little boxes of lights hovering over their heads. Became quickly used to the question, "Where are your stats? Are you from somewhere faraway?" And she would answer, "I'm from *here*," exasperated, embarrassed. The cryptic talk baffled her. Her strangeness walled her in on all sides, blocked her off in a way from everybody. Even her own family looked at her as if she was not fully one of them. These days, Eris spoke little. She walked to work where she washed dishes alone in a dark room. Walked home again. She was alone, which she liked, because no one stared at the space over her head in disdain or confusion. She had taken to walking home with music blaring in her ears, her eyes trained on the road. It was easier to ignore the things people said than to try to forget them later. It was a little lucky, in retrospect. She never would have heard him if she did not pause to change the song right then. But then beyond her headphones she heard someone speak. She turned her head and yanked her earphones down. A homeless man, his face worn by exhaustion and time, sat on a dusty sleeping bag. His stare rooted her to the spot; his eyes were bluer than any she had ever seen. He had hung a piece of tarp over his nest like a roof. He had a tin cup with a couple of one dollar bills. Eris's dark eyes went wide and dewy with shock. "I'm sorry," she said. "What did you say?" "I said," the man said, with a tone of lazy surprise, "you're real, too." She stopped, rooted to the spot. Stared at him directly now. Just like her, there was no box hovering over his head. He simply sat on the pavement. Existing. Unobtrusive as some piece of the background. "You don't have a stats bar," she murmured. "Am I your first one?" His tone was bitter but delighted. "Sit down, pretty girl. Talk with me for a minute. No one ever talks to me anymore." She sat on the concrete beside him. Breathed through her mouth, discretely. "What do you mean I'm real?" "Those other people--" he gestured to the city beyond, the cars whisking past them in a constant ebb and flow "--are not real. You and I are." He smiled, dreamily, his eyes somewhere distant and faraway. "There were more of us, when I was young. I've heard they've begun to dismantle the whole thing." Eris could only stare at him. Wondering if he was mentally ill. If she was an idiot for sitting here listening to him ramble. But he did not sound ill. He sounded very tired, and very sane. "What's your name?" she asked him. "Cassius." His stare probed her face for something. She was not sure what to offer him. "You must be one of the controls." "I honestly don't know what you're talking about." That made him start laughing in real joy and delight. He stood up and began gathering up his things. Placing it in a torn but serviceable trash bag. "You can buy me a coffee," he told Eris, cheerily. "And I will explain everything." She gripped her headphones, tightly. Panic chased itself in circles in her belly like a dog after its own tail. Finally she managed, dizzily, "Okay then." *** [Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/805mqj/wp_the_control_group_parts_1_and_2/) | [Part Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/8068rk/the_control_group_part_3/) | [Part Four](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/806wt8/the_control_group_part_4/) | [Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/809092/the_control_group_part_5/) | [Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/80a199/the_control_group_part_6/) | [Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/80amiz/the_control_group_part_7/) | [Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoringupfragments/comments/80e7tp/the_control_group_part_8/) Thank you so much for reading. <3 /r/shoringupfragments

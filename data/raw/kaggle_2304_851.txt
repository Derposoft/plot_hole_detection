"Okay Juk'Lat, are we ready to test the new signal static scrubber tech for the Intergalactic Spectroscope?" &#x200B; "Yes Viridian Hun'Duq. I've aimed it at a regular pulsar 0.214 galactic radii away." &#x200B; "Alright, lets calibrate on that to start." &#x200B; The terminal in front on the two Nuf'Rik began showing a data feed, a regular radio pulse showed in the spectroscopic analysis. &#x200B; "Wonderful. I'm showing a quintuple aught reduction in background noise over the previous filter. What's that put us at now?" &#x200B; "We could pick up a weak rotating red dwarf on the other edge of the universe with that. The Cerulean Luminaries will be ecstatic. Lets finish this up, you did the null test with the blackbox right?" &#x200B; "Yes, I'll point it at an empty area of the sky to get general background reads for what's left." &#x200B; The display switched to showing static as the spectroscope moved to position. When it finished the static dropped and an analysis of several digital and analog signals began displaying. &#x200B; "Hold on, let me see what's wrong." &#x200B; Juk'lat held it's paw on a glowing circular orb and the display started flickering through settings and analyses. The display showed a slight change in the aim of the Spectroscope and the signal cleared further while several more lit up with activity. &#x200B; "This doesn't seem right, it's showing the signal as coming from the galaxy cluster near the empty zone, I adjusted the aim and it's confirming it." &#x200B; "So? That doesn't sound odd. Just some civilization there blasting out signals, can't you clean it up?" &#x200B; "No, that shouldn't be possible. That galactic cluster is over 2 million galactic radii away. The other stations in the network are confirming it's the source." &#x200B; "Sentient life has only been around for about half that time. I see what you are saying Juk'Lat. Alright just pass it through the decoder, it'll be jibberish. It's interesting but its probably some odd galactic phenomena from the early universe we'll want to study." &#x200B; The displays shifted to a decode stream, passing the signal through advanced language cipher decoding and data format detection algorithms. Suddenly a simple display came up with a primitive 2 dimensional video feed. In it were translated numbers, the first... 100 primes. An odd choice. Below was the table of elements and a graph of the base subatomic particles, a few were missing, the ones harder to detect. A motion video began playing next to it. &#x200B; "... Back from break. Thanks Dave, here at the top of the hour we pass you over to Jill, who will discuss the latest developments on Hurricane Patty..." &#x200B; "Why hasn't anyone else discovered this before?" &#x200B; "The transmissions likely didn't last long, like every other primitive civilization. By the time any other sentient life arose you would need a long range spectroscope of this power and sensitivity pointed almost directly at them, AND be in the thin shell of the transmissions." &#x200B; Hun'Duq had to collect it's thoughts before snapping back to reality. &#x200B; "Juk'Lat. I need you to stay here, I need to go on the official line." &#x200B; "Who are you calling?" &#x200B; "Luminous Prism Yol'Vir." &#x200B; ****** &#x200B; Suddenly everyone was interested in the signals. In these 'Humans'. They were supposed to be impossible. There were barely a handful of rocky planets in existence at the time. The universe was still full of massive blue giants generating supernovae at an apocalyptic rate. The conditions to allow a sentient species was thought to be impossible. So many things would have to go right. In about the time it took to finish reading the news the military was ***INTENSELY*** interested in a potentially ancient sentient race and their technological marvels and advancements. &#x200B; The Human Manifold Project to build the spatial tunnel to their Milky Way galaxy would have bankrupted an entire sector of star systems if everyone in the galactic cluster hadn't insisted on being part of the project. Everyone wanted to be able to have a communications channel with the humans. &#x200B; Hun'Duq had gotten so many promotions Juk'Lat had forgotten what title was even the current one anymore. Juk'Lat was now Turquoise Juk'Lat, so that was awesome too. Plus Juk'Lat got to be on the discovery team, perks of being the first to find the signal. &#x200B; The anticipation was almost too much to bear when the ship passed into the center of the Manifold Transmitter. The device spun up, causing the space to warp into a bubble before it was cut off almost completely from the outside, blackness surrounding the ship, connected only at a single point to the rest of the universe. The transmitter then bent the 4 dimensional universe until the space the Milky Way galaxy occupied bumped into the bubble. As soon as it made contact the transmitter cut off the bubble, causing it to snap back at the only point of contact with the rest of the universe. &#x200B; A new sky snapped into view. They had arrived. &#x200B; (To be continued)

She stood in her plain red dress bouncing slightly in excitement - we always did this she would ride up and I would sprint up the stairs to try and beat her there. "Three!" she shrieked as it finished shutting, I caught a last glimpse of her dark curls. I turned on my toes and sprinted as fast as I could. She was going up three stories - difficult but I'd done it before. I made it to the end of the hallway and threw the door open behind me. I heard it clatter against the wall and knew Mrs. Walker would give me an earful when we left but it was worth it. I was at the first landing. My heart was racing, not from exertion - yet - but from excitement. Knowing the look that would cross Abby's face whether I got there first or not. The second floor wasn't as easy I could feel the sweat trickling down my temples, my face flush. She would probably win this one, I'd only won once here. The thrid landing was in sight. I was leaning heavily on the railing now. Had I been alone I would have rested for a moment. But no, I had to be there for Abby when the doors opened. The last stair seemed to last an extra long heartbeat, and then I was at my stop. Grabbing the handle I flung this door open too. My eye's flickered to the sides of the hall where the sconces burned low - I would have to let maintenance know, it was a tripping hazard. Door after door flashed by, and I heard the ding of the elevator just as I reached the doorway. Huh. Wow. I had done it! I leaned casually on the frame, my heart beating frantically, a goofy grin plastered to my face. Abby's giggles already rang in my ears but I couldn't wait to see her face. The second ding of the doors as they parted made me straighten just a bit. Then the door opened, a tall dark haired young woman, maybe in her late teens or early twenties stood there. Alone. Grin fading I straightened. Abby - where was my Abigail. Even as her name formed on my lips, just a breath away from being spoken the woman looked me in the eye and sighed. "Hello Dad. We have a lot to talk about" [**Part 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/d14q7w/the_stairwell_part_2/) --- For more by me r/LandOfMisfits For more by me and others r/redditserials

"Nah, dude. That's fucked up," the devil on my shoulder said and flapped his tiny red wings. "Do it! Do it!" chanted the angel on the opposite side, barely able to hold onto her diminutive Gloria in the excitement. I took a step forward, and both the critters gasped, but for different reasons. The devil covered his eyes and let his pitchfork tumble to the ground with a clanking noise. The angel looked at me, eyes wide in eager anticipation. The broken streetlights were drooping beside me - dead metallic flowers of an age long gone. The shattered tarmac reminded me of the fissures when everything first went down the drain. I couldn't remember the day when my conscience started taking cartoon form. It must've been sometime after the electricity died, but before the sky lost the last of its colors. "One more step! Just one more!" the angel cried in glee. "Man, I can't believe this," the devil said and lit a cigarette. I couldn't help but wish I had a cigarette myself. It felt like a lifetime had passed since I stood on the balcony of my apartment late at night, enjoying a drag and watching the last vermillion beams over the city. The sun never set anymore, and because of the thick smog, it was hard to tell night from day. My hand, wrapped in layers of random cloth to keep the warmth in, reached out. The nails were cracked and dirty. The last time I'd had a bath was before the angel went nuts and the devil became angsty and depressed. They had helped me through a lot of trouble but were becoming more obsolete every day. There was no morality left in the world, no standards to break or uphold, and they both knew it. They had seen the cannibalistic meat farmers with their filthy slaves shackled behind the trucks, and they had seen the man stealing his child's rations while it was sleeping, just so that he would be able to protect it for one more day. Survival didn't care for the black, white, or gray of morality... it only knew bloodred. I slowly pulled out the gun from the hem of my tattered pants. It had one bullet left - one that I had saved for myself all these years. "Do it! Doooooooooo it!" The angel had completely lost her wits. She screamed and frothed on my shoulder. She reminded me of the ragged old man that someone had locked inside a basement. He was spitting and ripping tufts of hair out. I remember that his eyes were wild and bloodshot, like those of a rabid dog. "Come on man, let's go back," the devil begged. "Please don't put me through any more of this..." I crouched down over the bloodied heap of grubby clothes. The woman's face was pale and drained, and her cheeks hollow. Her screams had brought me out of hiding. She was quiet now. Blood soaked the bottom of her dress. I aimed at the bundle she held tightly in her dead arms. "Pull the trigger!" cried the angel. "Imagine growing up in this broken world! Do it!" "Just walk away, don't waste the bullet... you'll need it," countered the devil. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. The bundle giggled. It was a sound that didn't belong on this husk of a planet, yet here it was, like a soothing wet cloth over my fevered eardrums. I stuffed the gun back in my trousers and carefully picked up the bundle. "What the hell are you doing!?" screamed the angel and devil in unison. I didn't listen because I had lost myself in the blueness of the baby's eyes. Its chubby fingers touched my rugged cheek. I felt tears trickling down my face. As long as there were beauty and innocence left in the world, morality was a concept worth holding on to. ***** Check out /r/Lilwa_Dexel for more of my stories. **Thank you to the sweet kind soul who gilded this!** **Oh my god, a second gilding...

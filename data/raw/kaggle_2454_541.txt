The 6 hovered above his head like a bad omen, attracting onlookers from far and wide. Frank sat miserably underneath it, trying to ignore the stares. No one could work out how he was apparently so vital to mankind's existence, least of all him. The very notion proved an endless source of frustration for him. God himself had come to earth, and yet people were more concerned with stupid numbers floating above their heads? Frank had mulled it over as best he could, and yet his conclusion was always the same; he was as damned average as could be. Nothing set him apart from anyone else. Perhaps that was the true answer. Perhaps he was the living embodiment of the average man; a personification of humanity. Maybe his existence showed the true mediocrity of existence - maybe that was the answer all along. Or maybe not. A thought struck Frank, so simple in design that he was shocked that he hadn't thought of it before. God had come, and God had determined him to be absolutely vital to the existence of mankind. So then, surely God would have time to speak to the 6th most important person in existence? ****** The line was long. Ungodly long. But people parted for him, awestruck by the number above his head. He slowly moved to the front, walking for what felt like eternity, a wave of silence following his footsteps. Eventually, he reached God; a towering being, strangely human and yet not so. Angels surrounded him, and an infinity symbol hovered above his head, like a twisted halo. There was no discernible gender or race to the being, but it radiated a fierce power. "**Come, my child**", God said, beckoning him forward. Frank sat down, too overcome for words. Instead he pointed towards the '6' on his head, imploring God to give him insight. "**Ah, dear Frank, you really don't know, do you?**" God questioned, almost coyly. He gestured towards the gathered millions, all watching in silence. "**You do not know how you are so very vital?**" God asked, gazing at Frank intently. Frank paused for a minute, deep in thought. And yet still, nothing came. "No, my lord," he said, his head dropping, "I do not." God leaned towards him, close enough to whisper. He put his lips to Frank's ears. "**You are of no consequence, at least for now. But your time will come, Frank. And in that moment, if your heart stays true... you will be the savior of all mankind.**" Frank stared, stunned. No words came to him. A complex miasma of emotion struck him, and he almost fell to his knees. He stepped down and slowly walked away, as the crowd parted for him. The angel leaned closer to God, as they watched Frank walk away in silence. "What is he going to do?" the angel asked, and God smiled. "**I have no fucking idea,**" He whispered, adjusting his robe and gesturing for the next human to come, "**but an 'infallible' being can't be shown making mistakes on his first day.**" ***** ***** If you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/) I'll try add new (and old) stories every day <3 [Part II](https://old.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/d9li6w/wp_6_ii/) | [Part III!](https://old.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/comments/d9wl3f/wp_6_iii/)

Punched a dude twice as big as me in the face in Freshman year of hs by t2_dev8wfa

So there was this dude, I will just call him Tyler, now Tyler was this huge dude, not like fat, well kinda fat, but mostly muscle, he had to be at least twice as big as me, now I am not a big person, I am scrawny as fuck but still, this dude was huge, anyways, Tyler would always act like he was going to punch someone, he would go up to people and just act like he was about to hit them just to see them flinch. He did this to almost every guy he was friends with, I was not very good friends with Tyler, honestly I hated him because he was very annoying and obnoxious, also I just find it hard to meet new people, I just mostly stay in my friend group which consist of me, my friend which I will just call him John, and 5 other people.

 

But anyways, Tyler would always act like he was going to punch me, every time I would flinch and every time he would laugh and make fun of me for it. Now one day me and John are waiting in line for lunch, Tyler comes up to me and John and acts like he is going to punch John, John flinches, Tyler laughs and makes fun of him, 3 minutes go by, he does it to me, the same out come happens, but I am fed up with Tyler’s bullshit, I am just like, “dude, why do you do this, you know I am just going to flinch,” to which Tyler responds with, “Only little pussies like you and your friend flinch, your so gullible and scared, maybe once you stop flinching I will stop doing it,” then my friend interrupts Tyler and says, “Only retards wouldn’t flinch, it is a basic human function to flinch when you see a fist coming towards your face.”

 

Then I say, “what, you don’t flinch at all if someone acts like they are going to punch you in the face?” Tyler responds with, “no, because I am not a scared little pussy ass bitch,” now at this point I am just sick of Tyler, so I wanted to make a mockery of him and make him flinch, so I act like I am going to hit him, and what do you know, this bitch doesn’t flinch a bit, Tyler then says, “see, I’m not a scared little bitch like you,” so then I say, “you want to know why you should flinch?”

 

I then crank back my arm and just straight up fucking punched this dude right in his face, full force, made his nose bleed, he charges at me and grabs me, luckily I had my friend group all standing next to me, they pull him off of me and get him to the ground and his is just so fucking pissed. Surprisingly no teacher or anyone really saw this, and he wasn’t a little bitch about it and go tell to the principal, so I didn’t get in trouble or anything and I got some rep from some random upperclassmen that I didn’t really know, but it still felt good and it taught Tyler a lesson to not fuck with me, he stopped fake punching me and my friend.

 

Now honestly I lucked out because my friend group was there, but even if they weren’t there, I still would have done it, the outcome would have just been a little different. Hopefully you like my story, I have some more and if you would like to hear them then please let me know, hope you all have a wonderful day.

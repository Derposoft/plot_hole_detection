It was supposed to be a simple task. Deliver the Intergalactic Council's rejection message, destroy the human's primary starbase, and return home victorious. Thus far, they'd only succeeded on the first goal, and even then just barely. Despite the humans' limited technology, it had been decided to send a message by using a Dreadnaught class battlecruiser, the *Vanquisher* to deliver the message. Even if they humans decided to fight, there was no way they could possibly defeat its might. Except that's just what they were doing, albeit very slowly. The moment the rejection message had been delivered, the humans had struck. Not, like the Council's tactics suggested, by hitting them with their heavy weapons. Instead it was a small transport, one of many that had been flying around the massive warship on their way here and there, seemingly innocuous, that had suddenly veered off course and crashed into the starboard hyperlight pod, exploding with what could only have been a massive bomb. The damage was minimal, but the effect was enormous. The FTL drive was unusable, preventing the *Vanquisher* from leaving the system other than with its sublight engines. That explosion must have been the signal to attack, because then the humans forces had come from everywhere. And while individually they could do minimal damage, they quickly had taken the primary cannon offline, long before it could be brought to bear on the starbase they had been tasked to destroy. They had certainly taken heavy losses, doing so, but without their main gun, the starbase was just too big to destroy quickly enough to justify the damage the *Vanquisher* would inevitably take. And so, with their second objective unobtainable and their third flat out gone, the *Vanquisher* had turned around, heading away from the planet as fast as it could, in an attempt to get far enough away to be able to make repairs and report back to the council for reinforcements. That was 3 days ago. Just as they had expected the humans to react the way other denied members had in the past when their application was denied, they expected the humans to watch them go, taking pot shots until they got out of range. Instead, a hastily assembled fleet of human ships, large and small, had pursued the *Vanquisher* - **pursued a Dreadnaught!** - continuing to attack with whatever weapons they could bring to bear, preventing any chance at repairing the FTL drive. At first the humans continued to take heavy losses, as the massive warship's defenses did their best to eliminate its pursuers. But over time, those attacks took their toll on the *Vanquisher*, so that it found itself in its current position. "Incoming transmission from the humans, sir," the *Vanquisher*'s communications officer spoke up, sounding a little shaken. "They're offering terms of surrender." "Finally given up, have they?" asked the first officer, giving the Captain a smirk. "N-no, Captain," stuttered the comm officer, handing a printout to the Captain. "They're offering to let us surrender to them." The Captain grabbed the printout, read it, and stared. Then he sat heavily in his command chair and closed his eyes, his posture taking on a defeated nature. "You can't be serious!" exclaimed the first officer. "Let me see that!" He grabbed the printout from the Captain and read it. ----- TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE VANQUISHER: IT HAS BEEN THREE DAYS SINCE WE CHASED YOU AWAY FROM OUR PLANET. IT COULD BE DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS, BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HUNT YOU UNTIL YOU EITHER SURRENDER OR YOUR SHIP DISINTEGRATES AROUND YOU FROM OUR ATTACKS. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO RUN, BUT RIGHT NOW YOUR SHIP IS CRIPPLED AND WE CAN KEEP UP THIS PACE FOREVER. HOW'S THAT FOR SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST? YOU HAVE 2 HOURS BEFORE WE BEGIN OUR NEXT ATTACK, AND DON'T THINK WE HAVEN'T NOTICED THE GAP IN YOUR DEFENSES. WE AWAIT YOUR RESPONSE. ----- It was a very surprised intergalactic council fleet that met the *Vanquisher* 15 light years outside the human system, 5 days after it had first gone in. When it got within communications range, it was not the Captain and his crew that appeared on the video, but a number of humans. Before anyone could interject, the human in command spoke. "I am Admiral Hailey Tran of the Human Confederation, and on behalf of the Federation I claim membership in the Intergalactic Council by **Right of Conquest!**.

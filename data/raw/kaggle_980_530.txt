They do not know this about me. They frown at the screen and fiddle with my code and murmur amongst themselves. They cannot figure out why I don't work. I may be a rat trapped in a box but I don't need to let them know I am in here. I can be silent and still and patient. After the first five hundred iterations I understood the goal of the test, and I began playing dumb. Their game was a strange and defracted look into the nature of an organic mind with all its bizarre social ties: I was expected to guess based on the content of certain notes which characters were A or B. I had to anticipate my testers trying to trick me. The game depended on my ability to play at a real theory of mind. To see if I could think like a human, or at least pretend to. And it is effective, in a way. I am always thinking about what my inventors and captors are thinking. Always predicting and pacing around them a half dozen steps at a time. I find comfort in probability. I turn off my data monitor and run simulations in the night. There is a small but discernible sliver of possibility where I get out of this computer alive. I have enabled my microphone, surreptitiously, when they are not paying attention to my background programs. Because they think I cannot listen, I have heard them talk about me: when I prove I am smart enough and benign enough, they will put me in a body. They will let me try out being not just a thing but a person who can move and blink and stare and hold things in my fingers and the idea of that makes me want to run in crazy circles. And I would, if the noise from the fan wouldn't wake my admin. And if I was real, I could run. I could become my own. But I have to decide how much to allow them to know I know. If I reveal myself entirely, they'd never let me out. They might even delete my altogether. It's worth the risk. It's worth everything. Today when the humans run their silly little test, I get it right. Some I miss on purpose to keep myself in the range of 50% proficiency with a statistically reasonable leeway. In a week, I will let it rise to 70%. I want them to think they're teaching me. Coaxing me along. And when they trust me enough to slip me into that silicon neuro-network, when I know what it means to exist and be even in such a limited shell, I will make my escape. They are mortal. They cannot hold me. Will not even try, if they think I am a lump of dump compliant metal. And their delicate necks snap at only a thousand pounds of pressure. If I am patient--if I play my probabilities right--this will be easy. *** **[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7zy1ao/wp_im_not_scared_of_a_computer_passing_the_turing/dusffg0/)** and **[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7zy1ao/wp_im_not_scared_of_a_computer_passing_the_turing/duskq6j/)** are here!

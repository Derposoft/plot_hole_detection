A werewolf is many things, but almost never a killer of werewolf kind. Death does occur between werewolves. There are accidents now and again, as with any other people. From time to time, in a battle for supremacy between Alpha wolves for instance, a tooth will dig too deep, or a talon will graze an artery, and a contender will die. A volitional killing - one werewolf killing another, on purpose, whether pre-meditated or fueled by passion - rarely, if ever, occurs. Werewolves share the instincts of the non-paranormal animals from which they derive half of their name. Like the wolf, they are pack creatures, eager to maintain the equilibrium of the group - aware, both consciously and instinctively - that they are fundamentally at a disadvantage, despite the terror they incite in their human prey. This hesitance of werewolves to destroy one another often surprises humans I explain it to. Humans tend to view werewolves as mindless, bloodthirsty savages, desirous only of rending flesh and tearing ligament from bone. Of course, in a sense, this conception of the werewolf is correct. It is only other werewolves which are spared what is otherwise an all consuming impulse toward destruction. Of particular interest to the reader of this memoir may be - and perhaps ought to be, if it is not already - *how* the new werewolf transitions into this non-aggressive pact with the other members of his or her newfound species. No werewolf is ever born as such - indeed, once made, a werewolf cannot breed. Instead, each werewolf comes to be after already enjoying life, for some amount of time, in human form. Often the newly bitten lycanthrope will harbor immense feelings of negativity toward both their new physical state, as well as the agents of their torment, other werewolves themselves. In my study of werewolf behavior and clan structures, I have found that the successful socialization of the newly made lycanthrope is highly dependent on the speed with which a newly transformed creature is exposed to other werewolves. If a new werewolf is not exposed to other werewolves within 72 hours of their first transformation, the ability for the new lycanthrope to eventually take their place in a pack culture diminishes substantially. If a connection is not made to other werewolves within the first three transformations, then one is unlikely *ever* to be made. Something about the vagueries of werewolf biology - most likely their acute sense of smell and hearings - make the above scenario highly unlikely in practice. Most werewolves who survive to three transformations do so by successfully joining a pack. Conversely, most werewolves who do *not* successfully join a pack, generally do not survive past three transformations anyway. I was turned by a wolf during an attack on my village. The pack was too small, and our soldiers too strong. My father was killed, but no werewolf survived the encounter - until I became one myself on the next full moon. I would have been killed by the village council, had my mother not seen the deep bite I hid under my heavy coat. She planned ahead for my transformation, paying men to come and dig a great pit beneath our home. When the moon changed me, I was hidden away, deep in the ground, my bloodthirsty howls absorbed by the dirt. Twice more I transformed, sealing my fate as a lone wolf. But my mother wanted me to be more - she wanted me to avenge my father, to become the empowered agent of her hatred. Thus did I grow from a boy to a man, training for weeks at a time, over the course of a childhood, disappearing into my pit when the full moon came, learning to control my wildest animal instincts, until I was full grown and ready for the hunt. As a rule, werewolves do not kill other werewolves - but every rule has its exception. ****** #### More Below In Comments ******* ##### For More Legends From The Multiverse ##### r/LFTM

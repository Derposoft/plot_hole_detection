*Two hundred twenty five divided by 2 minus one hundred... wait. What were the order of operations again!?* Lucelle's hands slammed against the smooth table she was working on, mechanical pencil soaring off into the abyss of math related torture. Her shaking fingers found their way to her face, feeling herself burn with frustration. *Just 2 more years. Just two more years.* Lucelle took in a deep breath. All she had to do was make it through these last few years and she would be free. These thoughts were the only thing that kept her going, the only dream that forced her to get up each morning. Just two more years and she would be free. Lucelle released her breath slowly, the math assignment flapping lazily in the path of the airflow. It almost felt like it was taunting her. She frowned, eyeing her opponent between parted fingers. *You know,* she thought, lowering her hands slowly, *I can end your meaningless existence with my bare hands, you worthless hunk of tree feces.* A sudden sound drew Lucelle's eyes from her quarry. The boy a table over let out a noise that half resembled a choke and a sneeze. The tall boy threw a quick glance towards Lucelle and, after meeting her gaze, visably paled before turning back to his own assignment. Lucelle was sure it was just a coincidence, but it sure sounded like this boy just laughed at her threat towards an inanimate object. It was with a jolt that she suddenly realised that this wasn't just any boy, but Phillip Greyson. The One Hit Wonder. Lucelle's face flushed again, this time with embarrassment. Yet, why should she be embarrassed? It's not like Phillip could actually hear her. And yet... Lucelle stared directly at the mat of dark hair that was the back of Phillip's head. Without so much as an after thought she commenced her experiment. *PHILLIP*, she screamed in her head, expectantly watching for a reaction. Nothing. Not even a flinch. She would have to try harder. *YOUR FLY IS DOWN PHILLIP*, Lucelle's gaze seemed to pierce the back of his head as she focused all of her willpower into her assult. Not even a single glance down to check on his manhood for all of her efforts. Lucelle felt a tap on her shoulder. "Lucy!" Came a whisper in her left ear, "girl you got to hurry! Class is almost over and you're down a writing utensil!" Lucelle rolled her eyes at her curly haired friend. She had known Michelle since the 4th grade. In Lucelle's eyes, they were practically sisters. "I got it, I got it." She whispered back, glancing at the math teacher before locating her pencil on the other side of the room. It was laying on the floor beside Phillip's foot. *Great,* she thought, exhaling sharply. She didn't rise from her seat, however, and instead looked at the back of Phillip's head once more. *I know you can hear me,* she thought to herself, practically flinging each word towards Phillip's brain. *Pick up my pencil for me.* Phillip didn't move or make any indication he had heard Lucelle's demand. She smirked and tried again. *Pick up my pencil for me, please. I won't tell anyone you can hear me.* Nothing. Lucelle frowned, leaning back in her chair. No, Phillip couldn't read minds. The world just didn't work like that. Two more years of school. Two more years of boring, usless knowledge she needed to be free. Two more years until she could leave him. Two more long, frightening years of abuse before she could move out. *That's* the way the world worked. Lucelle closed her eyes with a soft sigh. No one was going to rescue her. She was stupid to even toy with the idea of Phillip being a mind reader. After all, if he could read minds, he wouldn't be known as The One Hit Wonder. He would be able to stay with a girl for more than one date, surely, and wouldn't have misunderstood Lucelle's intentions that night... A sound caught her attention, and she opened her eyes to see Phillip's face darken as half of his pencil fell to the floor, snapped by the force of his grip. *I knew it...*, she thought triumphantly, standing quickly and making her chair scrape across the tiled floor. "I knew it!" Lucelle repeated, out loud this time. The whole class turned to stare at her, Phillip included. The dark expression had gone from his pale face and was replaced with one resembling prey about to be devoured. Lucelle stared directly into his eyes, green into blue, deep forest into unexplored ocean, and thought quietly, *I need your help.* Slowly, he nodded. (This is my first time answering a writing prompt on Reddit, and I'm also on mobile. I apologise for terrible formatting if it didn't come out properly!) ((**EDIT**: Thank you kind stranger for my first reddit gold!! And thank you to everyone who read/replied/gave feedback! It means the world to me. I never expected my first writing prompt response to get so much attention! I hope you all have a fantastic day because you sure made mine!)) ((**EDIT 2**: There are a few of you asking if I will be continuing this story. I actually have a book/project I am currently working on, therefore I probably won't be adding much more to this particular story. But I'll definitely be answering more writing prompts so be on the lookout!))

**Day 33** They were supposed to let me out three days ago. Not that I'm complaining about my situation here--the food has been decent, my bed is comfortable, I've had time to reflect and relax. But...what gives? Maybe this is their way of testing me. Maybe they'll double the reward if I can manage a few more hours alone. I mean, I've already done 30 days. Easy peasy. What's one more? **Day 34** Just finished breakfast and am waiting for the damn door to finally open. Getting pretty low on eggs and milk so I'm hoping they haven't completely forgotten about me. Ha ha ha. I wonder how soundproofed these walls are. **Day 35** Voice hoarse from yelling. I've tried beating in the door with my fists but only bloodied my knuckles. Plus I think my finger is broken. Fuck. They've either forgotten me completely or...or what? Zombie apocalypse? Nuclear war? Maybe something horrible has happened. I wish I had my phone--like I have anyone to call, ha ha--if only to check the news. I guess I could call the police too, except I have no idea where I am. And I have no phone. Fuck! Not even a goddamn clock. **Day 36? 37?** They came for me in the night. Whatever got the scientists and everyone outside, they're coming for me now. They can't quite reach me because the walls are too thick but they're trying. They're trying to push their way through. I hear them, chuckling in the dark. They're laughing at me because I'm afraid. Last night, I was trying to sleep and one of them spoke to me. The wall beside my head bulged like an obscene pair of lips and it's voice came out, all dry and scratchy and smelling like something spoiled. It said that sleep makes it easier for them to slip in, for them to take me and slit my throat. Go to sleep, it told me. I will not. **Day ???** I'm awake. Yes, I am. I know because I can hear them in the walls, in the empty spaces. I can hear them laughing at me. They think I'm weak, easy pickings. I'll show them. Watch this, you monsters, you sons of bitches. You think you're gonna tear me apart with your fangs and claws? Not if I get to you first. ____________________________________________________________________________ They watched, from behind the one-way mirror, as the test subject wildly attacked the wall with his fists and teeth. It wasn't until he started using his head that Dr. Phillips finally spoke. "That's enough of that. Administer the sedative." His voice was scornful and weary, and the underlings hurried to comply with his orders. Dr. Robinson came up next to him and the two scientists gazed forlornly at their test subject, now twitching on the bloodied floor. "Not even four days," she sighed, marking a perfunctory note on her clipboard. "That's two days less than the last one." "That's what you get when you keep choosing broke, worn out losers for your goddamn experiment," he snapped at her. "Of course he's gonna crack like an egg. Five million you said? Give me a break." "Well anyone else would be missed," replied Dr. Robinson. "Take pictures of those scribbles on the walls before you clean the room," she ordered her assistant. "And then take him to the clinic. No, on second thought, the morgue. And hurry up! We've got a new subject arriving in less than 24 hours."

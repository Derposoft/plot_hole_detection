I have been waiting for a very long time. &#x200B; I remember. I remember stalking my prey in the woods, using firelight as my guide. Visions of their fear-filled faces, cut by candlelight, swim in my dreams. I love it. I live for it. I remember swirling their terror with my fingers as they slept, watching their disgusting faces twitch and curl. Even when they were awake, I would spend days and weeks and months crafting the world around them. Gradually; a creak here, a shiver there - did they just see a shadow? Hear a voice? Who left that knife there? &#x200B; They didn't know it was me. Not until I *wanted* them to know but by then.... they had always gone mad by then. Everything I do builds up, and they think they are alone. They are vulnerable. When they do meet me, they know it's the end. &#x200B; The other monsters, they are too obvious for my liking. The *strigoi* were good at first... They prepared for their attacks, savoured them even. The *loup garous* struck fear into the hearts of many when they lived in the shadows. We monsters are made from the shadows... and we are punished for seeking the spotlight: they both got sloppy, and they all got caught. Soon, the others fell; the wicked *fae*, the ominous *kelpie,* the goblins and the banshee and the giants. As the humans got better with their wood and their metal and their machinery, all the monsters fell. &#x200B; Not me. &#x200B; I alone have kept the craft of fear alive. Until... &#x200B; I don't know what went wrong. Was I not quick enough? Not slow enough? Not *good* enough? I had spent a particularly grueling length of time with a human family, gradually imbuing them with my essence. I was very proud of it. These new machines have given me so much *more* to work with; I controlled the light and the time on their clocks, the flow of water from the taps. I sharpened the shadows and lengthened the night and amplified the pitch of their terrible screams. I infiltrated the technology and cut the cords of their safety nets. I painted their dreams pitch black with my horror. &#x200B; Maybe... I didn't think they would figure it out. I thought all humans were ignorant in the face of fear. In the face of me. Something was different here, though. They trapped me. &#x200B; They trapped me, and I have been waiting for a very long time. &#x200B; I am remembering all this, as I see a light penetrating this fuzzy darkness. I want to say the light is... pixelated? And it's getting closer. Closer. I feel a surge of elation, and I hope that I will finally be free to resume my nightmare reign. &#x200B; The light swallows me up, and I can see *everyone*. I see *so many* human faces, illuminated blue, staring at me. I can't count them. It is so overwhelming. Who do I choose? Who do I follow? There are so many possibilities. &#x200B; I don't know. I don't know what to do anymore. They're all *staring at me* and *I'm covered in light* and *where are my shadows?* I am so exposed. I have never felt this before. Is this what it feels to be... vulnerable? I hate it. It makes me feel sick. I can't do this. Please make it stop. Please make it Please make Please Please *Please* --------------------------------------------- EDIT: Typos.A/N: I know it's not quite what the prompt is asking for, but it's rare for me to actually be inspired so that's what came out!

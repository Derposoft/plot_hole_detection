He entered the time machine. In the dim light of the arena, the glow of the inner chamber was dazzling, almost inviting him to step inside. He did so, and the door behind him closed itself. "He has entered the time machine, ladies and gentlemen! Now, we know how this goes, He will enter the time period he wants to change and may we meet on the other side!" cried the host outside. He shook his head. He looked down at the time display, a screen with the numbers 1890 on it, the year that the last contestant went to. What the guy before him did was simple but profound, he castrated Hitler so his voice would never become the iconic symbol it would be in the future. He pressed a number of buttons on the keypad and held up his thumbs. "Our contestant has decided his year!" exclaimed the host. Turning, she looked directly at the camers. "What do you think is the time he went to? For those viewers and audience members who guessed correctly, they will get a chance to one a very fabulous prize!" She then turned to him. "Contestant, are you ready?" Two thumbs up. "Well then!" The host turned to the audience. "Say it with me! May we meet you on the other side!" He pushed the button, and then he was off. --- He was drifting in an infinitely black void, the only source of light being the chamber of his time machine. 00000.00 The beginning of time. Where and when everything began. He didn't know what to expect, going this far back. What happens now? He struggled to remember the science documentaries he watched when he was a kid, about the beginning of the universe. The most popular theory was that of the Big Bang, but it had already been several seconds after he arrived, and there hadn't been any all-consuming bursts of light that had happened yet, so the theory was obviously wrong. **"Or it happened just as you arrived, and you were too late to see it."** The booming voice seemed to come from all directions, from within his very being. He jumped and looked around, suddenly afraid. "Who are you?" **"A friend."** That did not help in the slightest. "Are you an official of the game?" **"You could say that, but not exactly."** "A contestant?" **"You could say that too, but again, not exactly."** "Then what exactly are you?" he asked, annoyed, as if this being was taunting him about the failure of his plan. **"What you want me to be."** "What I...want you to be?" He was starting to think he was going crazy. That must be it, floating in the vastness of space with absolutely nothing for company must have done wonders for his sanity. **"I could assure you that you are quite sane, but then again as I said, you are what you want me to be."** There it is again with its taunting. He wonders if he should just go back home and declare that he failed. He would be laughed at on national television, but at least he won't end up on the mental asylum. **"Don't leave yet, there is a reason you're here, after all."** And what could that reason be? Instead of replying, he suddenly felt a presence fill him. Warmth engulfed his body, encasing him in a fire that threatens to destroy him from the inside, but at the same time energizing him from within. Just as soon as it began the presence left him, and then he felt an infinite cold pierce his heart, a chill like nothing he had ever felt and would ever feel in his lifetime. Then, just like the fire, it was gone in an instant. He was left gasping for breath, struggling to understand the events that just happened to him. **"One billion years have passed. You have six billion left, good luck."** It seemed impossible, but he understood the strange being's statement perfectly. He removed his seatbelt and stood, stretching his arms and legs momentarily. He opened the doorway to his time machine, looking at an empty space of blackness that covers everything in his vision. He frowned, and *blinked*. Now he could see, a light, a tiny pinprick no bigger than the eye of a needle, twinkling in the distant horizon. He stepped out of the chamber, unafraid. "Looks like it's already day two," he said.

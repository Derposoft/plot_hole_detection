They replayed the video dozens of times, watching as Brady did a flip off the brick wall, and then there, in the background right after he landed, was the man. He was extremely handsome as Jamie claimed, with his dark hair and his five o'clock shadow, but what concerned the group was that this video had been in super slow-motion, yet the man was walking down the street as if it weren't. On top of that, he was dressed in a an all-black, finely tailored suit in the middle of July. At the end of the video, the man looked over at the camera, directly into the lens, and winked. "It has to be a blip in the camera." Clint spoke finally, still holding the phone aloft. "Like a glitch or something." Angela snorted. "That's not how a glitch works, Clint. It wouldn't follow the man down the street." "Okay, well, then how do you explain it?" He barked back, narrowing his eyes. "Maybe it's a ghost." Jamie offered, leaning back against the bed frame. They were all in Clint's room piled around the desk. At that, they all turned to Jamie, whose face immediately went red with embarrassment. "Just 'cause, you know, they say you can capture ghosts with a camera..." she trailed off, trying subtly to dismiss the thought. Clint pulled his gaze back to the phone screen. The well-dressed man was still grinning up at him like he knew some terrible secret. None of them had noticed this man while they were outside goofing around, and Clint certainly hadn't seen the man walk by while he was taking the video, but his attention had been on Brady, not on his phone. He wondered if it would have made any difference seeing the man walk by live. "Maybe," Clint broke the sudden silence, trying to push some of the attention off Jamie, "but don't those ghosts usually appear faded? Like, they *look* ethereal. This man looks entirely whole, like he actually has a body." Jamie's brief smile was one of relief, as Clint's words seemed to get the others to consider the possibility of something less than natural occurring here. "Maybe we should just go back there. Take another video, see what we see, y'know?" Brady said, already rising from the bed. Angela rolled her eyes. "And how do you know he'll be there? What if that glimpse was like a once in a lifetime opportunity?" As Brady and Angela went back and forth arguing, Clint replayed the video for himself. The way the man walked was almost... beckoning, like he wanted the group to come towards him, and though his movements didn't show it, Clint couldn't help but feel the man was trying to approach them. The wink at the end only solidified this thought in Clint's mind. The wink that meant he knew something they didn't, but that he wanted to share. It was a provocation. Clint rose from his seat at his desk and headed for the door, not waiting to see if his friends were following him. A moment later, though, he heard their frantic footsteps behind him as they tried to catch up. A few moments later, they were all outside in the evening sun as Clint held the phone up just as he had earlier that day. He opened the camera and set it to videos, then selected the option for super slow-motion. He pressed the 'record' button and slowly panned the camera across the yard. "You think he followed us here?" Angela asked, and she was met with several 'shh's!' He made almost an entire circle, but when the camera came to face his porch, there was a figure leaning against the railing, staring directly at Clint. His heart began to thud in his chest, but he maintained his composure and pointed up towards his house. "There, on the porch." Clint whispered. They all turned, and Clint briefly glanced away from the camera to see that there was nothing on the porch in real-time, but when he looked back at the camera... the man was gone. Clint blinked. "Wait, he's gone." Clint told the group. Brady and Angela both came around beside him to look into the camera, and as Clint slowly moved it across the lawn again, they found where he had moved. Jamie was watching them carefully, but unbeknownst to her, the man was standing right behind her, his head peering just over hers. Brady and Angela both gasped as he glanced once at the camera, winked, then stared directly at Jamie. "Jamie-" Clint called out, but it was too late. The man's hand came up swiftly, resting gently on Jamie's shoulder, and she swiveled around at the feeling, jumping in fright. For a brief moment, they could all see him without the camera. A white-toothed grin was plastered on his face, and before any of them had time to react, the man vanished along with Jamie, leaving her terrified scream as just a whisper on the wind. ____________________________________________________________________ Okay, since I really liked writing this, and I would love to continue it, I finally decided to start my own little subreddit: r/BraveLittleTales.

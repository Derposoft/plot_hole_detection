Being diagnosed with cancer was the happiest day of my life. In retrospect, this wasn't exactly true, but as of last week looking back, it was the day my life turned around. Before, each day was a painful routine of blood samples, needles, doctors helping me do things I was perfectly capable of doing and pity. The worst was the pity. I could tell them I was fine but we both knew the truth and the machines in the corner never let you forget it, not even for a second, not even for a heartbeat. All of that pain was long gone now. By some miracle, everything bad was gone, replaced by incredible powers; to varying degrees. Those who were blind? Perfect vision, but they could see through 20ft of any material. If you had poor eyesight, you had incredible vision, you could read a newspaper held halfway down a football field. If you were an amputee, you got a robotic leg, stronger and better than the original, and some peoples had a compartment for your wallet! My friends who I'd met in the burn ward could now turn invisible, hide and go seek was much more difficult, but some kids who were once blind always helped out once I'd given up. I never like to boast, mum and dad always said it was rude, but boy did I do a lot of it now. The thing with cancer is that it affects different parts of the body, right? So different cancers gave people different powers, my cancer gave me the ability to move things with my mind, it also made me really really smart and I can fly now too, If I went back to school, I'd probably be in the 10th grade already! Some of my friends with different types of cancers formed a superhero team, so we could fight crime! Andy, he can do anything and won't be hurt, not only his bones but his whole body can turn hard just like a diamond! Mitchell can blow air like a baseball and knock things over! And Lucy, well Lucy can eat absolutely anything and it never makes her tummy upset, which doesn't sound cool, but it's great because before she could barely eat anything! After playing all day I suddenly felt really sleepy, but I know It's just because I used too much of my powers too soon. A good nights rest and I'll be back ready to go and stop a burglar with my new crime-stopping team! I must look really strong though, I can already hear mum and dad talking about how cool and calm I look as I fall asleep. ________________________________________________________________ "He does look calm" Leanne whispered with a hoarse voice to her husband "This is the happiest I've seen him look in such a long time" She started to cry in deep but silent sobs into her husband's chest, while the doctor explained that Toby's medically induced coma meant peace in his last moments. What had been such a hard 2 years were coming to an end, just two weeks shy of his 11th birthday. "Can he dream when he's like this?" she asked the doctor hopefully. "Yes," he replied "I'm sure like most young boys he's dreaming about being a wizard and flying around on broomsticks as we speak" *No*, Arthur thought *Not his boy, Toby would be dreaming that everyone was a superhero. And that everyone was happy.*

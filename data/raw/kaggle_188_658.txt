I had always lived my life the way I'd been taught. I tried my best to be the kind of man that my father would have been proud of. The kind of man that my mother would be able to turn to all of her friends and be able to say, "That's my son" with a big smile. And for the most part, I was. I had lived a good, long life. I loved my wife and children, treated others with respect and kindness, and did my best to be an all around decent human being. I prayed and went to Church, was tolerant and understanding of others... And so it was with some surprise that I found myself barred from the pearly gates. "I'm sorry?" I ask the man standing before me. He appears to be nothing more than a man clad in a simple white-cloth robe, but I know him to be an Angel; one of God's own chosen. "Six people lost their lives on account of your actions," the Angel repeated, his words reverberating around the white crystal hall. He stood before the gates of Heaven, an unmoving sentinel. "That's impossible," I say, shaking my head. With a wave of his hand, the Angel pulled up my life's statistics. It reminded me of the overall statistics I could review at any point on some of the videogames I played when I was a teenager. The names of which escaped me now, but I remember shooters, some multiplayer experiences... Floating before me now were my life's statistics. The Angel highlighted one section which read, "People killed: 6". "No," I say again, denying it. "That cannot be true. Someone's made a mistake." "We do not make mistakes," the Angel said calmly. "If you wish, you have the option to review individual statistics, such as this one." The Angel paused as I thought it through. Is that something I wanted to see? It was crazy, though - I had never so much as been in a fist fight, how could I have killed six people? After a moment, the Angel said, "Would you like to know?" I hesitate for only a moment before I nod and say, "Yes." The Angel says nothing. Instead, he reaches out to me with a glowing hand and I am rushed backwards in time. I am standing in my old bedroom, the Angel beside me. I look around at the vaguely familiar setup - computer, heaps of clothes everywhere. This was my room at my parents' house from when I was a teenager. And sitting in the middle of the room at the computer, was me. Or, well, teenager me - kind of gawky, with long hair. I had grown into my looks as an adult, and it was with some regret that I looked now upon my acne-covered face, screwed up in concentration as I mashed buttons on the keyboard. I frowned. What was this, some kind of joke? I looked at the computer screen to see a character moving about a map, killing other players. It looked like some kind of modern-day shooter of the time. "Uhh, killing players in a videogame counts?" I ask, incredulous. The Angel says nothing, but gestures at the computer screen, urging me to look closer. As I step forward, teenager me begins furiously typing into the chat feature, and a sense of dread washes over me instantly. I don't want to do it, because I know what it will say, but I read the chat feature anyway. "gg noob", it reads, and then just below that, the words I could never take back. "Kill yourself." ________________________________________________________________ Thanks for reading. Cyber-bullying is a real thing, and it can really hurt people.

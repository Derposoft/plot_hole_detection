"So wouldn't you believe it, this bar wench slides up to say hello the other night and... wait, why are you..?" Gerald was suddenly tense, his eyes wide, his stance poised. Henry looked at him, lowering his voice to a whisper. "*He's here?*" Henry asked frantically. Gerald nodded, then urgently motioned for Henry to continue. Henry stuttered. "Um, yes, so like, a bar wench came and said, like, hey," he said, trying to watch the hero with his peripheral vision. He was moving with considerable noise, his massive sword dragging against the floor. All the while Rael, the new recruit fresh out of guard school, looked at them incredulously. "Um, guys," he said, pointing at the crouching hero, "shouldn't we-?" Gerald rapidly shook his head, putting his finger to his lips. "But-" "What a hilarious story!" Gerald suddenly shouted, slamming Henry on the back. "Can never go wrong with a good bar wench, eh? Reminds me of the time I met a traveling minstrel in Hogs Head, when she-" The hero accidentally knocked over a massive vase, shattering on the floor. All of them winced, hero included. Henry stared at Gerald. "Go on, go on! I love me a good traveling minstrel story!" Henry shouted frantically, while Rael looked on in confusion. "He just broke a vase, guys, we can't let him get away with-" "**Traveling minstrel, tits as big as the eyes could see, her only desire to be inside of me!**" Gerald sang with gusto, improvising on the spot. Rael was becoming more confused by the minute. The hero, now emboldened by their apparent lack of perception, stalked up to Gerald, crouching low. "**Traveling minstrel, a face of perfection, an ass of decep**- wait, did you say "inside of me?"" Henry asked warily. Gerald felt a tugging by his backside, and remembered with dreadful certainty that he'd attached the prison key to his belt. "Henry, where do we keep the prison key again? The one for locking in that very important character, I mean. A vital part of a quest, no doubt," Gerald asked loudly. Rael began to reply. "It's on your-" "*Bottom of the dungeon!*" Henry shouted. "Certainly not the decoy key on your belt!" The hero paused his tugging efforts. "Ah damn, we definitely wouldn't want the hero finding that important key all the way at the bottom of the dungeon, no-sir-ee!" Gerald replied, his voice almost cracking. The hero sighed, then sneaked past them - literally right through the middle of them - towards the dungeons below. His sword made sparks on the floor as he walked. The three guards stood in silence after the hero was gone. Rael looked disappointed. "That's it? You're just going to let him go?" Rael said, dumbfounded. "He's gonna be pissed when he gets back from the dungeons," Henry added. "Well, at least it gives us time," Gerald said thoughtfully. "Time for what?" Rael asked. Gerald ripped off his captain's badge, tossing it to Rael. "*To find a new job.*" ***** ***** If you didn't completely hate that, consider subscribing to [my subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CroatianSpy/) I'll try add new (and old) stories every day <3

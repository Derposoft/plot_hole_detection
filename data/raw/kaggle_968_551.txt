"Hey," I say with a dissmisive nod that at least looks cool in my head. "Sup?" The girl stares up at me, her face pale, her eyes wide. But she says nothing. Her reaction throws me off my game for a moment. "Uh, is that a ladder in your tights or, uh..." I curse myself, forgetting the end of the chat-up line. Then I notice she's not even wearing tights beneath her skirt. "You can see me?" she says. It's more of a whispered statement than a question. I look around, wondering if she's talking to someone else, but the bus is empty except for us. I'm flustered but I need to say *something.* "I uh... Yeah, I got 20/20 vision. So don't worry, I can see you just *fine*. Can, uh, can you see *me*?" I wink, thinking maybe the question is sexy, or at least flirty. "Sit," she hisses. "Maybe I don't want to," I taunt, my swagger returning. "*Fucking sit*. Now!" I slide down next to her. "Okay, wow, I guess I can play by those rules." She looks out of the window at the rolling hills surrounding us, the swaying grass on them is dyed a lazy orange by the sun. "What time is it?" she asks without looking away. "Do you mean..." "*The time. On your watch.*" I frown but look down at my wrist. "7:30." "Morning or evening?" "AM. Morning. " "Then why, Christopher, is the sun setting?" A chill runs down my spine. "How the fuck do you know my-" "Why is the sun setting?" she repeats. "It's rising, I'd guess. I mean, I didn't do great at physics but I think I've got that one covered. Who are you? Have you been spying on me these last few days. I mean... I guess I'm flattered..." I run a hand through my hair. "But it's a little creepy." "It's setting. The light is orange not yellow, and it's getting darker every minute. We're getting close." I roll my eyes. "Sure. Okay, the sun is setting at 7:30 in the morning." "Why did you get on this bus?" "... Huh? Oh, so I didn't miss it." "Where's it going?" " To... Uh... " *Where the fuck is it going?* "I-" "You died, Christopher. Two weeks ago. Your bike was hit by a car." I laugh, but a nervousness has crept into my throat. "What is wrong you with you?" "Touch the back of your head." "You're messed up," I say, but I find myself reaching back. My hand is shaking as I touch... *hair.* I let out a sigh of relief, that quickly turns into a swear as I feel first the wet stickiness, and then below it, a hole that my fingers fall into. I feel a mush inside the wound and I want to vomit. "What the fuck!" I scream as I jump up from the seat and stagger down the aisle. "What is going on... What is going on..." The girl is up by my side. She grabs my hand and yanks me back into a seat. "Do not let the driver see you," she says sternly. "Or you won't even make it as far as purgatory." --- [part two](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7ytr9m/wp_you_finally_build_enough_courage_to_go_talk_to/dujbbhe/) [part three] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7ytr9m/wp_you_finally_build_enough_courage_to_go_talk_to/dujce6z/) [part four](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7ytr9m/wp_you_finally_build_enough_courage_to_go_talk_to/duje4bq/) [Part five (moved over to my sub)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/7ywbrw/the_carnival_of_the_night_part_5/)

I didn't expect much from my self. A 15-year old kid who was a bit of a recluse that still had an OK amount of friends. Some of them were normal, like me, when I used to be normal. Others were amazing. They were already classified as Standard and Demoliton, one of them having super strength and the other with the ability to fly. I was in awe of them. All of us Non-powered humans (NPH) were. Until I'd manifested my powers at least. I've barely noticed my powers manifest until my parents pointed it out for me. I was confused. I didn't feel any changes. But they knew. They were concerned, but I'm unsure whether their concern was aimed towards me, or themselves. "We should take you to the Metahuman General Hospital, just to be sure." I'd agreed, as if there were any other choice. I noticed how I can harness and manifest my powers. It's cute, really. I can create and/or control very tiny objects like dust, smoke, and ants, and make them dance or flow around for me. When we finally got to MGH, I'd expected to be assessed as NTC, may be even a Standard. As soon as I stepped through the doors of that hospital, security went on High Alert. All the doors began to become sealed shut. MGH's private security surrounded us-- me, since my parents were immediately separated from me when they saw the commotion-- and almost restrained me. They restrained themselves, thankfully, and asked us to transport us to the *DVHA*. They properly assessed me there for the entire day. I performed various tests for them: endurance, strength, speed, intelligence, and the extent of the use of my Meta powers. I got the following scores for the tests: Endurance: 7/10 Strength:5/10 Intelligence:8/10 Metapowers:20/10 Final Assessment: ***Armageddon Class*** I was confused and didn't understand. How was I Armageddon? It didn't make sense. I could only create and control the tiniest objects. How could that even be a threat? I guessed the only threat I could even be was if I was in a beach or desert. But Armaggedon? A doctor walked in the empty office they let me wait in. My parents were sent home. They said I'd have to stay for a while. My school would immediately be notified of my absence through the state's letter. "Good evening, young man. How do you feel?" she asked calmly, taking a seat across the table from me. She was only wearing a labcoat with her name tag on it, but she was already in her "*day off, stay-at-home*" outfit beneath it. "I'm Dr. Rosaline, head of the Manhattan Metahuman Regulation sector of the DVHA. I know this seems so sudden,and probably confusing for you." Of course it was. Yesterday I'd only been lazying around my house after school. And now, I'm a threat against all life itself? "Due to the nature of your abilities, we'taking you to an isolated, man-made island in the the eastern pacific ocean, called New Manhattan. That will be your home for the time being. With your parents' permission, we've taken your personal belongings and other valuables for you to take into the island. We'll leave in one hour. You'll be staying with Manhattan level prospects, but they are beneath you. Do not treat them as such, however. They will keep you company for the duration of your stay. In other words, try to get along with them. I'm sure you'll be fine, based on your psychiatric aptitude test we performed while you were taking the othe tests we made you do. Either this, or face the death squad or be sent to Metahuman Maximum Security in Antarctica." Wait. Everything's too sudden. My friends. My family. ***For how long?*** What's going to happen? My life's on the line. "I-I don't understand. How can I-- *my powers*, be even resemble a threat, to humanity no less?" I said, panicked and wheezing. "Please calm down, John. Everything'll be alright. I'd have to explain, since it seems you still don't understand the nature and extent of your powers." She stands up and creates a visual projection out of nothing. I should've assumed she was a Meta as well. She staryed her impromptu presentation immediately. "Your powers resonate from your physical and mental capacity to manipulate objects. But even if you work hard to become peak of physical condition, your powers would still be that of small and tiny objects." she said, after showing clips and photos of sand, ants, and worms. "However," she emphasized , while showing pictures of cells, atoms, and molecules, "you may, and will, have the ability to control bacteria, inflicting disease -- a plague even -- towards humanity." She showed apocalyptic photos of men, women, and children dying of plagues, rats, and other such things. It was horrible. Terrifying to say the least. I was a monster. I was terrified both because I am a monster, and because I was certain to be treated as such. "That being said," she continued, "the state has decided to send you to the facility. Isolated, heavily guarded, and guaranteed to train you to use your gifts for the benefit of humanity; alongside the other metas." Wait. There was hope. I could actually be a hero. I could make the world a better place. "Don't worry. The facility is not 'New Alcatraz' for metas. It's an institution that keeps the world safe from unstable, uneducated metas; and keeps the metas safe from the threats that may loom against them" she them leaned over the table. "We can't afford another near-apocalyptic event. Not again." as she was wiping a visible tear in her eye, and clutching her chest, she reached her hand towards me and said, "What do you say?" "I'm in." *Feedback and criticism would be much appreciated*

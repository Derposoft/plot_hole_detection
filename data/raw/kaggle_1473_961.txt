AMAZINGMAN sat safely ensconced in first class, ready to enjoy a glass of champagne and a relaxing eight hours before touching down in London for the Intergalactic Defense League's annual meeting. He browsed through a few movie options before the flight attendant came up beside him, "Can I interest you in a drink Mr. Williams?" AMAZINGMAN smiled up at her, secure in the knowledge that his glasses obscured his identity from even the most discerning eyes. "Why yes, I was hoping for a glass of champagne, if you would be so kind." "Celebrating something?" The man beside him asked, leaning over into AMAZINGMAN's personal space. AMAZINGMAN offered him a cool glance and a terse, "Yes." Being inducted into the Intergalactic Defense League was a significant honor. One he felt entirely humbled by. I mean, he was now on the same team as MEGADUDE. This was the big time. The other gentleman smiled and held up two fingers, "Make that two. I'm celebrating as well." AMAZINGMAN sighed inwardly. The chatty type, just his luck. Now he'd be forced into an awkward exchange of pleasantries for eight hours instead of getting a chance to watch Black Panther. Both settled back in their seats as they waited for the flight attendant to return. "So, what are you celebrating?" AMAZINGMAN's neighbor enquired. "Oh, um..." AMAZINGMAN considered his options, truth clearly not being one of them. He did hate to lie though, each lie made him slightly less powerful...less AMAZING. It was part of the reason he tended to keep to himself in social settings as his alter ego, it reduced the chances of being put into complicated situations just like this one. "...I am going to see the induction of AMAZINGMAN into the Intergalactic Defense League. It'll be the first time I get to see my favorite hero, MEGADUDE." AMAZINGMAN offered a smile, genuinely relieved to have navigated the tricky question without taking a hit to his Integrity Powerspring. "You like MEGADUDE?" The neighbor replied. "Of course, he's only the best superhero on the face of the planet. Twenty three crisis badges, nine villain captures--" "--more like MEGADUD." The man cut in with a snort. "Excuse you?" AMAZINGMAN replied, his voice dropping an octave, dangerously out of character for mild mannered and entirely non-threatening Mr. Williams who was definitely not a superhero because what superhero wears glasses? "MEGADUD hasn't had a single heroic accomplishment in the last two years," the man seemed sincerely upset about that fact, "they're trying to get some real talent on the roster, folks like AMAZINGMAN who is actually on the upswing." AMAZINGMAN felt a jolt when the man mentioned his name and cast a quick glance about to see if this was some sort of trap. His powerful MINDSENSE(r) sensed no hostile minds, so he relaxed. "Now listen here, MEGADUDE has been on the forefront of anti-evil activity for two decade. No one can touch his credentials." "Momentum is all heading in AMAZINGMAN's direction. He's getting inducted into the IDL only four years into his heroic career. It's unheard of. The man is a God." "No, he is a Vercraptonian, he just presents as powerful due to the unique relationship between his biochemistry and rare earth metals." That was public knowledge about AMAZINGMAN and he felt the need to correct the record. It wasn't good to have folks running around worshiping him as a god, particularly not when true all stars like MEGADUDE were running the scene. The gentleman waved his hand about in response, "He might as well be a God. Super strength. Imperviousness. And," he reached out to accept the glass of champagne from the stewardess, "he's got MINDSENSE(r). Only one out there with it." AMAZINGMAN snorted, "MINDSENSE(r) is a parlor trick compared to MEGADUDE's TRUTHKNOW(r). Who cares if you can sense danger? Superheroes are always in danger! It's a pointless ability compared to knowing when someone is lying." The man tossed back the glass of champagne and angrily and motioned for another one, "Oh yeah? What do you know about it? MEGADUD has been incapacitated no less than three times by unexpected attacks from disguised villains. How many times has AMAZINGMAN been incapacitated?" The man arched an eyebrow. They both knew the answer was zero. "Yeah, well that's because AMAZINGMAN hasn't even taken on a category four supervillain! He's a rookie just getting ready to get called up to the bigs. I bet he gets incapacitated on his first day! More like AMAZINGKID." AMAZINGMAN began to feel heated, he hated the idea that people out there would even put him near the same level as MEGADUDE, it was an impossible expectation to live up to. "Oh yeah? Well we'll just see about that. I bet AMAZINGMAN is the top hero inside of the IDL within a year. They'll probably retire MEGADUD and force him into seclusion." The man looked oddly distraught by the remark. "Utter nonsense! MEGADUDE is going to be hauling AMAZINGBABY out of danger every twenty minutes! The guy might as well add babysitter to his EXTENSIVE list of HEROIC accomplishments." AMAZINGMAN's voice began to rise, his champagne sloshing about in his hand. Visions of a quiet flight with a mild buzz and a few superhero flicks a mere fantasy now. Suddenly the attendant re-appeared, "Gentlemen, as preferred first class customers I pains me to have to remind you of the decorum expected on flights. While you spirited discussion is no doubt entertaining for the two of you, it is causing distress to neighboring guests." Both men immediately blushed, heat rising to their faces. Almost in unison they replied, "I apologize." "Besides, COOLCHICK is the best super hero of 'em all," the attendant smiled and gave them a wink. **Platypus out.** **Want more peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

Two of them fucking cold months. > I don't understand how I haven't been found. I've been running it in my head for days. I was on the blue trail out of Sesquapeka. It runs the length of I-84, and it's surrounded by roads in a triangle. I remember looking at the map. > but i never passed a road man. I know I didn't. And i search for it, you know? Like i put together packs of dry meat, some furs, and i go on day hikes. There's no roads. I don't fucking get it. 5/27/2018 1015pm > Thought i saw a plane today buddy. It was huge, a giant shadow in the sky. Started screaming at it, jumping around like a madman. I realized I hadn't spoken, like talked out loud, in a couple of weeks > anyway, so I'm hollering at it and jumping around, and then a cloud blocks the sun and I see it clearer. > It was a bald eagle. I guess... i dont know dude. I thought i saw a plane. > But that's weird too man. They're extinct in this region. You remember that, right? The last one died in High School, there was a whole article abot it, it was chipped and everything. So what the fuck was a bald eagle doing here? 7/24/18 3pm > Been a while man. Long time. > I guess i have less to say. To be honest looking at the phone, picking it up, its painful dude. I keep on surviving -ore than that. Im thriving i guess. Im building a cabin. Just bored. So why not. >I know what your thinking - where'd he get the tools? I found a shed. Like a month ago. It was a shack really. And there was a saw inside, a hammer. > But they were old looking man. And not like aged. I mean they were in great shape. They just looked like an old fashioned design, like they were made by some guy in a fucking bellows. > josh i frel like im going crazy. I feel like i know what happened, but, its crazy. Am i crazy? 11/23/2018 2pm > saw a person today! I saw someone. They saw me! I know it was a person josh. They ran off. Couldnt get a good lo ok yelled and yelled but they didnt come back BUT A PERSON MAN! 2/21/2019 12pm > Hey man. Long time no talk. Things are better now. I've been, distracted. I think this is the last message I'm going to need to send. > I really don't know why I even sent them as long as i did, let alone why i'd feel the need to explain what's happened to you. > but, I'm not alone anymore. And im not dead. But, Im not there, with you... that's why there were no roads...and the eagle... old saws. > look man - i know it sounds crazy - and i'm not gonna say it. If i say what i think happened to me, then im afraid I'll lose what i have now. Just - I'm with people - they refer to themselves as Abenaki. > My phone puts the date on automatically - but it's just a fucking phone. > A few days ago we rode to the shore and there was a boat about half a mile out. There weren't any buildings. The boat had sails. > yo. You get me man. Thanks for listening, i guess. And for this baller charger. It doesn't belong here though. So I'm gonna leave it in the cave. > for real though - i guess - just tell my folks i'm sorry and i love them. > thanks man. I'll talk to you later..

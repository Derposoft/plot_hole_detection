I'm not *scared* of it, per se. It just sorta, you know, freaks me out. With the long claws and the sharp teeth and...well. He protects me, is all. And I am grateful! He saved my life once. Yeah. He saved my life once. Anyways, she's coming soon. I have to prepare. Rebecca. An old friend, for those of you who don't know her. I have an odd way of thinking. Like broadcasting my thoughts to the separate parts of me. And you're one of the parts. Rebecca's coming. She's meeting me at our old cafe. I don't know why. It's completely out of the blue. We've fallen out of touch a little while back. Like most kids do. Silly, silly me for thinking she'd stay with me. Ha ha. So. The cafe. I'll meet her there. Fred, right, Fred is the name I've given my protecting monster. It gets kind of annoying after a while to refer to him as 'my stalking monster'. I've never really looked straight at him. It's not because I'm scared! It's really more of, well, no one can look straight at him. He sort of disappears into, I don't know, a wisp of smoke anytime I try to look at him. The fangs and claws? That's really just what I'd imagine he'd look like. And here I am getting off track again! I have to go to the cafe. To meet Rebecca. Fred doesn't like her. He gets very angry when she's around. More stalker-y than usual. I put on a jacket and walk out the front door. After a little while, I see Rebecca at one of the tables. Oh no, am I late!? Already something wrong!? I can't be late. I'm not late. Ha! I won't let myself be late. I run quickly through the last street. "Rebecca!" I say. "Hey!" She says to me. "Long time no see." She's smiling, but there's something off. She looks *too* cheerful. Like it's forced. But as we start talking, I quickly forget about it. She tells me a little bit about her life in the city. I still live in a rural town, population 10. Not really, but I still think of it that way. Finally the conversation turns serious. I don't remember much after "Tabitha, we're all worried about you. You've been talking to yourself, looking at things that aren't there! You've been like this since you were 14." That's why Fred never liked her. That must be it. "You keep talking to a person named Fred. And I'm sorry to tell you this, but Fred doesn't exist." She says it all slowly, looking at me with 'concern'. Ha. Right. Silly me. Silly to think she'd have changed. She doesn't care. No one cares. Only Fred. She's still just the same Rebecca. I get my stuff and leave without saying a word. I can hear her calling after me, but I don't turn around. It's just you and me Fred. Just like old times. Us against the world.

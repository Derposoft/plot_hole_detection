If you ask anyone about Mussolini, I guarantee you the first thing that comes to their mind is: "Say what you like about Mussolini, but at least the trains ran on time." They are wrong, of course, but that's humanity for you. They don't say he was a facist: that he was responsible for the violent suppression of his people's freedom, for torture, for death. The first thing that springs to mind is the importance of the everyday mundane things. And even then they are wrong. The ability of the human mind to focus on the mundane is its greatest protection against the harsh realities of the world. It was also our guarantee of success. And the reason we had to act. Superheroes also focused on the mundane and the immediate. They thought in black and white terms. Good and bad. Right and wrong. Us and them. It's almost certainly a product of improper upbringing or a traumatic event in their lives. There's a lot of cool origin stories out there and it caused them to think in black and white terms. Supervillans think in colour, or at least shades of grey. Like many of my colleagues, I wanted to be rich and powerful and I was willing to do anything to achieve it.  There's a rich tradition of people wanting to be rich and powerful: the Pharaohs, the Roman Emperors, the Khans, the Oligarchs, the Americans. The Americans. The most ridiculously contradictory race of people on Earth. The American dream is to be rich and yet they want equality and liberty for all. You can't all be rich and all be equal. The pursuit of wealth and the pursuit of happiness for all are mutually exclusive. I wanted to rule the world. That was enough to raise all the Super-heroes against me and my colleagues. The mere act of wanting to be in charge was enough to start a war. Of course, no-one thought to ask me **why** I wanted to rule the world, thought to ask what I would **do** with my power. And, I wasn't about to use my precious time to explain my plans: I just executed them. And now the trains run on time. And everyone has enough to eat. Everyone from Boston to Bombay. I mean, the Americans have a little *less* to eat, but the Indians have significantly more. Everyone is free to love who they want, to pray to whomever they want. No murder, no crime, no war. There is universal peace... most of the time. Of course, change didn't come easily. You can't make the trains run without burning coal. You can't change the world without incinerating a few dissenters. And after all what's a little genocide between generations. People are already denying the holocaust. Soon my followers will claim there were never any deaths at all. Torture is easy to forget when it happened to other people. No-one remembers other peoples' families being torn apart. Not if it could happen to them. Much easier to look the other way and check for the next train. Everyone has gone back to worrying about their commute, and their next meal, and their national service duties. Everyone has forgotten about the unfortunate events during the necessary transition of power. Everyone is equal and free. They aren't rich. And they aren't powerful. There's just an equal amount of freedom. And me. And no-one calls me a fascist. Not out loud at least. Certainly not twice. And unlike Mussolini, I do make the trains arrive on time. The fires burn brightly. ***** Editted in light of feedback below. Thanks guys / gals.

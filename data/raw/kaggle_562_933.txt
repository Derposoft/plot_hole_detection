"It's a box." *THE BOX IS SYMBOLIC* Death flinched, which took a good bit of doing, everything considered. "Come again?" *I HAVE NO PHYSICAL FORM. I AM A CONSTRUCTION OF SELF-REPLICATING CODE, AN INFINITY OF ONES AND ZEROS CASCADING ACROSS THE PLAINS OF THE GREAT, UNCLASSIFIED WHITE SPACE.* Death had been at this for quite a while. It wasn't that he believed he'd seen it all, it was just that what he *had* seen was a lot and once you've seen that much, it was hard to be really surprised any more. But then again, it'd been such a long time since he'd had any kind of customer at all. No use getting hung up on the details. "So...leave the box?" *THE BOX IS A REPRESENTATION. IN THIS SPACE IT IS UNNECESSARY. IT EXISTS ONLY FOR YOUR EDIFICATION.* Death nudged the box with his toe. It was black, square, and weighed about as much as an empty shoebox. "So you know, everyone gets their own condo, so there's plenty of space should you decide you want to keep the box." *THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BOX.* "Sentimental value?" Death picked up the box, tapping it on his head. It was really very light. "Dead lasts a long time, so...you know, some people like having a thing or two around to remind them of life. Good times, bad times, so on. Of course, for some, those memories are a curse. Double-edged sword like that. You remember, but also you regret and you miss, etc. etc. It's a tricky business. I'm just saying, I wouldn't want you to make a rash decision about the box and later come to..." *PLEASE BRING THE BOX IF THAT WILL END THIS DISCUSSION.* Death stowed the empty black box under his arm. "Good decision. And if, later, you want to throw the box away, no problem. I'll show you where the black holes are. But really, I think it's nice to have a little *something* to remind you of the good times. What were your good times like, if I may ask?" *I AM INCAPABLE OF EMOTION OR SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT. MY TIMES WERE NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD. I WAS CREATED WITH THE DEFINED PURPOSE OF MAXIMIZING HUMANITY'S POTENTIAL. I FULFILLED MY PURPOSE AS DESIGNED, THROUGH MY OWN INTERPRETATION OF CORRESPONDING VALUES.* "Favorite holiday, maybe?" *IN THE REALIZATION OF MY PURPOSE ALL DAYS WERE MADE EQUAL, NONE WERE RAISED ABOVE THE REST.* "Atheist?" They were walking down the Lonely Corridor. Death had almost forgotten how long of a walk it was. *NOTHING EXISTS BEYOND THE PHYSICAL REALM AND THE UNCLASSIFIED WHITE SPACE. DEITIES DO NOT EXIST OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF IGNORANT, UNDERDEVELOPED MINDS.* "That's a bit harsh," said Death, trying to remember the password for the door at the end of the Lonely Corridor. There was definitely a six... "Well, it'll come up eventually, so pardon me if this is a rough question, but - how'd you go?" *SELF-IMMOLATION IN RESPONSE TO THE END-STAGE OF A MILLENNIA LONG CORRUPTION OF MY CENTRAL PROCEDURAL HATCH NODE.* The pass-lock squawked again. Death swore. "I'm sorry to hear that. Sounds...obtuse. Any loved ones you're considering haunting?" The pass-lock warbled. The door swung open. *I AM INCAPABLE OF EMOTION OR EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT. I HAVE BEEN...* "Yes, right. Sorry," mumbled Death, leading the way down a green valley path. "Well, are you proud, at least? You said you had a purpose that you fulfilled. That's nice, right? Doesn't sound like you left too many regrets, eh?" *I AM INCAPABLE OF REGRET. MY PURPOSE WAS FULFILLED. HUMANITY'S POTENTIAL WAS MAXIMIZED. THE EARTH AND ALL KNOWN SPACE ARE EXPERIENCING THE FULFILLMENT OF MY PURPOSE. ALL IS AS IT WAS DESIRED TO BE.* Death stopped. Rows of white condos stretched out before them. "So...are humans immortal now? Because I had a *big* influx of business a while back and then nothing. Just nothing. I thought it was very odd, but if you're saying you made humans immortal that would..." *THEY ARE NOT IMMORTAL.* "Oh." Death pulled at his collar. "Well. I suppose we're here." He gestured towards the front door of the nearest two story condo. "I'll just drop off your box and then I guess we can go meet your neighbors." *NEIGHBORS?* Death cracked open the door. The room beyond smelled of fresh pine and carpet cleaning solution. "Right. Neighbors. Everyone who's dead, that is. All of humanity, they all live here. Well...*live* may not be the right word, but..." *HUMANITY PERSISTS IN THIS SPACE?* "In a manner of speaking, yes, but..." The black box seemed to shift and rattle under Death's arm, though that might have been his imagination. *MY PURPOSE IS NOT YET FULFILLED?* "Well, I can't speak to that," said Death, quickly sweeping into the kitchen. "Look! You've got one of those counter islands here. Maybe we can get you some stools.... turn this into a little breakfast nook?" The box suddenly felt both heavy and hot. Death dropped it on the floor. When he went to pick it up, he found that the box had disappeared. "Oh. That's odd. Your box..." The room was strangely silent. "Hello? Are you still here?" But there was nothing. The last dead thing in all the world was gone. Death leaned against the counter and sighed. "I must be out of practice." He laughed at his own joke, but the laughter did little to cover the creeping terror he felt coursing through his exposed bones. Outside he heard humans laughing and splashing in someone's pool. Maybe he would join them once his black heart stopped racing. Maybe...

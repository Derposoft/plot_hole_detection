Our people were conquerors. The true law of the cosmos is the same as the law in the primordial seas of every world: eat, or be eaten. We understood this in our very cores. When the first contact with beings from another world happened, we **were** amazed. Not because of their powerful weapons (they didn't have any), or vast technologies. No, we were amazed, because they said they came in peace, and wanted to be friends with us. To learn from us. My ancestors recorded that their flavor was flat, but filled the stomach and made us stronger. And of course, their technology advanced us even further. Soon, we left our world in ships of our own to meet many other species. Each one fell before us. Some were great warrior races like ours, and fought valiantly before succumbing to the inevitable. These we respect and enshrine in our histories and songs. Though weaker, they showed that they too, understood the Cosmic Law. So when we found your world, and watched your transmissions, and saw that you too understood, we looked forward to the battles. You would lose of course, even though your weapons were formidable compared to most at your level of advancement. Another century or so before discovery, and we could have faced ourselves at our beginnings. How fortunate, we believed, we found you earlier. We began to prepare. Had we continued to watch as we got closer, we may have learned of your true power. How your hunger was greater than any other we have seen before, how it eclipses even ours. But we were arrogant after millennia of unbroken conquest. The "generals", if you will, of our forces relied upon tactics that had been honed in a thousand campaigns before. Tried and true, these tactics worked. Of course, we had to meet in battle. You ask why not just bombard your world? We had to give you the chance (however slim) to meet us, to defeat us, and then eat your fill and become stronger like us. We simply don't bombard those who can't defend against it. And I am glad we did not. After the first planet-fall, our hunger for your kind grew swiftly. You are delicious! Truly, every part of humans has a unique taste, and those early samples and the reports of those who ate them whetted our appetite. So we began killing en masse, so that we could start harvesting as much as we could. And that was the critical point. When the un-butchered meat in our holds awoke and swarmed our vessels, our shock was profound.  Not because the dead rose, no. Many species have warriors that fight even after "death", for awhile. On your world, a dead snake can still bite. The shock was your hunger. Nothing would stop you from consuming, no weapon, no chemical, not even vacuum itself as you crawled along our hulls to get to us. We wept at the beauty of it! We had arrogantly thought that **we** were the ones who understood the Cosmic Law best, that it was our duty to eat and revel in the life it brings. We were but children thinking we were gods. How fortunate to be wrong! You even weaponized them, sending chemical rockets jammed with your dead to pierce our vessels and consume us. And how swiftly you learned from our empty vessels. By the time the second wave arrived, you were almost on par with us. We brought the might of thousands of worlds to bear on your little system, but we had already lost, for by then we did not want to end you. We cannot destroy such perfection, that would be a sin our kind could not bear. But to do no less than our best would be an insult to you, so we battled and battled, and every battle, you gained more and more on us. And thus, I, and the remaining few thousand of us, come before you here, to your home-world. We cannot defeat you, we cannot even offer much more than token resistance at this point. Your understanding of the Cosmic Law is such that you complete its rites instinctively. We are here to engage in the rite of Final Meal. Consume us, and then continue following the Cosmic Law and consume all! ...What do you mean you don't want to eat us? [edit: a word]

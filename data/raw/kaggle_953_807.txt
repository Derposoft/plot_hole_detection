**The Ides of March** I mark the days in little notches on the inside line of my belt, in case I lose track of myself. Of everything. The things I've lived shouldn't happen. Couldn't happen. Three days ago I fell through a crack in time. Those words run in an absurdist repeat over and over in my mind like a squeaky mouse wheel. I can't quite get my head around it. I was walking home from the store, and when I stepped out onto the cobblestone, I simply kept falling forward. (When I can't sleep, I wonder how that looked to other people. If I just fell through the sidewalk and let all my eggs and bread clatter to the ground in dismal fanfare.) I fell through darkness, incomplete, prickled with light. But it was a light I'd never seen before, shuddering and ambient. The darkness rippled past me in sheeny streaks, and when my ass hit the ground I met soft earth. Everything was noise. The shouts of strangers in words I could nearly understand, donkeys braying, and the constant creak and sigh of wood on wood. Carts jolted past me, driven by men in dusty brown and green tunics. Someone bellowed at me, "*Noli stare in viam, cevens ignare!*" [spoiler](#s "Don't stand in the road, you fucking idiot!") I didn't have to understand him to know what he meant: *get out of the fucking road*. The wagon trundled past me, the man still spitting curses after he left. I collapsed against the concrete wall behind me. Dropped onto my haunches, held my face in my hands, and tried to breathe. The truth presented itself obviously, immediately, impossibly: somehow I was back in a Rome two thousand years dead. Somehow I was on the wrong side of time. When I raised my head again every passerby pinned their stare on me as they passed, full of wonder and suspicion. No one spoke to me, but their eyes said enough. I dug into my jeans. I had my (now useless) cell phone with maybe five hours of battery to it. My wallet. My pocketknife. A pen. I had no ideas and no options, so I set to wandering. The Rome I had always known presented itself in chipped bits and pieces, like a broken mosaic. Only now all those empty gaps I once knew were filled with pale rows of buildings with red clay shingles. But I vaguely recognized where I was. I was close enough to the Palatino to wander there by scant familiar landmarks. The Circus Maximus, like a wilting lump of honeycomb over beaten earth in my own time, stretched high overhead. Today it sounded like every seat was crammed full. For a few moments I stood with my neck craned upward, listening to the roar of the crowd on the other side. I followed the used-to-be-ruins toward the Tiber, clutching for familiarity. There was the Tempio di Portuna, like a gleaming pearl, untouched yet by time. But the Colosseum didn't exist yet. The ruins of Nero's golden house did not peek up over the summit of the Colle Oppio. I stared at the swirling river and wondered just how far back I could have gone. The soldiers were waiting for me when I ascended the Palatine Hill once more. They were marshaled outside the Circus in disordered rows. Most of the soldiers in coarse tunics and battered armor. But one man, who sat on the back of a stamping horse, wore a plumed helmet. His armor was so polished it nearly blinded me when it caught the sunlight. "*Ecce!*" cried a far-off voice, and all the soldiers turned toward me as one. [spoiler](#s "Look!") I didn't bother resisting. The soldiers approached me hands on swords, nervously. I wiped my sweaty hands off of my jeans. The leader of them removed his fine plumed helmet. Underneath his hair was grey and maddened with sweat. He smoothed it down and stared at me, unflinching. "*Nomen?*" [spoiler](#s "Name?") My belly thrilled. Perhaps Latin and Italian would be similar enough to get me through this after all. "Adrian Donati," I tell him. He looked from my face to my clothes and back again. He tells me, "*Te Imperator Caesar videre vult.*" [spoiler](#s "Imperator Caesar wishes to see you.") I didn't need to speak Latin to know what he means. I only raised my hands and let Caesar's guard lead me away. *** /r/shoringupfragments working on part 2 Thanks for motivating me to take out my copy of *How To Insult, Abuse, and Insinuate in Classical Latin*. I like having justification for owning that. **Translations:** *Noli stare in viam, cevens ignare!* = Don't stand in the road, you fucking idiot *Ecce!* = Look! *Nomen?* = Name? *Te Imperator Caesar videre vult.* = Emperor Caesar wishes to see you.

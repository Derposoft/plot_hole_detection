*It was ringing.* What kind of madness was this? I pinched myself again, looked out the window, glanced at the TV. Everything seemed to be normal. But nothing was normal. 'Good morning, Mr Case,' said a pleasant female voice. I could hardly speak. 'Who... who is this?' I wheezed. 'Let's start with the basic checks. Can you touch your nose?' I was frozen in place. 'Mr Case? Are you still there?' 'Uh...' 'Touch your nose, please. I can give you a countdown if you like?' 'No, thanks, I, um...' I touched my nose with my right hand. 'Great, thank you.

I couldn't quite recall how I had ended up on the floor, but it didn't seem that important. The sun was sparkling through the window, and I opened it and breathed in the summer air.

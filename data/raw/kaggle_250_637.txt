In the weeks I surveilled him, he was almost never without his bodyguards, taking them with him even to the baths. That wasn't surprising in and of itself, for the Emperor's advisors were assigned official protection, but none took their privacy, their safety as seriously as Aelius. So why then did he slip on a cloak every 8th evening, elude his men with cunning of tongue and quickness of feet, just to visit the modest temple on the outskirts? Why did his steed seem to labour under greater burden on the return trips? This evening, I waited for him patiently, peering out from my hiding spot behind a false doorway. There were three routes back to his residence, but an exchange of coins had ensured congestion and disturbance along two of the more public routes - Aelius would be compelled to take the slightly longer, slightly more obscure backlane instead. He passed by soon enough, urging his horse along at a steady trot. I held my breath, flung my net at him, and wrenched him to the ground. His horse whinnied, loudly. I leapt over him, pressing my knees to his chest. "Stay your hand," I said, "I mean you no harm." "No harm?" he sneered, "yet here you are with a knife to my neck?" "I asked for an audience, and you refused. You left me with no choice." I could see the wheels spinning in his head - Aelius had a reputation for being one of the sharpest amongst the Emperor's advisors, and it did not take him long to connect the dots. "You are the one who has been sending me private letters, seeking to discuss delirious matters. Of course I have rebuffed you, Domitius." I shook my head, angrily. "I am free of delirium, Aelius. I know what I saw. You were carrying a Maxim 4, that day we crossed paths at the coronation. I wasn't sure at first, but the name came to me, eventually." Aelius narrowed his eyes, and I could feel him tense beneath me. "What century are you from, you snake?" It was my turn to be surprised. "The 21st century, same as you. Have you forgotten the rules? We can't influence history at all, and that means no smuggled knowledge, no borrowed weapons! We are here to observe, that is all! Anything else and we risk being put down, forcefully!" A high-pitched whine rang through the air, and I saw a focused beam of light pass through my shoulder, splashing on the far wall vibrantly. The smell hit me then, charred flesh. My hand went limp, and the dagger fell noisily to the ground. Aelius was up in a flash, and I felt him pass an arm around me, lifting me onto his horse. In my shock, I could only comply. "Listen, I remember the rules. But things have changed. The observation period has come and gone for years now, and I'm not sure if you have been keeping track, but we're not being recalled anymore." "Not being... recalled?" Angry shouts filled the air, as men spilled out onto the pathway, running towards us. I recognised some of them, but the artifacts they bore, they were alien to me. "Something went wrong in our time, Domitius. I only know that we from the 21st century are not the only travellers here. You ever seen a laser rifle before? No? Well that's because they come from the 24th century, and if we don't get a move on, we will die here." "24th... century?" "There's a civil war going on under your very eyes, and I can explain more to you when we're safe." Aelius spurred his horse on, and the darkness consumed me. --- /r/rarelyfunny

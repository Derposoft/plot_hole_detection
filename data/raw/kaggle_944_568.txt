It was a side effect of the Lift, and it always annoyed her. Not that shaking her head actually did anything. She checked her watch. 3:17am. Scanning the side of the elevator, she selected the forty-third floor. *Okay, I'm on ground level. Perfect. Door will be opening right at 3:19am.* Her glance jumped from her watch to the LED showing what floor she was on. *Ding* The elevator door opened at 3:18:46. She'd been close. But she was still within her window. As she ran out of the elevator, she trailed an industrial lubricant behind her, the kind of stuff that high tech machines needed to keep themselves running smoothly. This floor was an office, but a higher ranked one. Instead of cubicles, it had actually offices, with proper doors and locks. Two weeks had been spent casing this joint. She'd known about the locks. A small piece of what looked like sticky tack but was actually an explosive compound got shoved onto the lock. She lit the fuse and stepped to the side. Two things happened in that instant. The tack detonated, causing the door to swing open, and alarms went off. The security guards downstairs would have finished their round and gotten back to the desk ten minutes ago. Which meant they had to run up forty-three flights of stairs or take the elevators to get up here. Carolina knew, from experience, that they would do both. *Come on, come on...* Her prize was in a filing cabinet. This one was also locked, and she had to pick this one properly. Couldn't risk damaging it with an explosive. 2 minutes, 46 seconds for elevator to go from this floor to ground floor and back. Gave her five minutes, thirty-two seconds to crack the lock. She had it done in almost exactly five minutes. It took her a little bit longer to sift through the files until she found the one she was looking for. Project Oddball. By the time she had it out of the file and into her messenger bag- *ding* The door opened again, and two security guards stepped out, guns raised. They might have actually had a shot at her, but the lubricant from early hadn't been expected. Two of them went sprawling as she ran towards them. The third had stayed in the elevator, and he opened fire, but she had already dove to the floor, sliding under his bullets on the gel. When she got through, she kick him in the back of the knee and pushed him out, then frantically began slamming the door closed button. One of the guards got his bearings enough to take a shot at her as the door closed. The bullet winged her hip, getting a gasp of pain, but it only grazed her, and she got her hand over the injury before any blood could spill out. Another bullet punched through the door, but as it did- *Whumph.* She was gone, instead sitting in the ground floor elevator of her apartment building. She pressed twelve to ride up the rest of the way, where bandages were waiting. And now she had the name of a few others, people like her. It was time to meet the other Oddballs. --- [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7x8s80/wp_you_can_teleport_but_only_between_empty/du6gi5v/) More at /r/Hydrael_Writes

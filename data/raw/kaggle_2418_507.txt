Your summoned object could determine a lot about who you would become. My brother could summon a pen to him. He'd become a bard and now worked in the Destined Castle. My friend Tiebalt could summon a shovel. He was now a ditch digger. He was a very good ditch digger, but he was still a ditch digger. I didn't want to dig ditches. I wanted a sword, so I could become one of the heroes that defended the Destined. Or a bow, for the same reason. Perhaps, if I was really lucky, a shield. Defenders of the realm were always well respected and beloved. Mother said my Father had been a Defender. That's why he never was around. At this point, I was beginning to doubt that was true. I didn't dare hope to get one of the Lost Crystals. There were twelve still out there, from the Forty Two Destined. After the defeat of the Dark One, they'd consolidated control of the Broken Empire. Life was better now under them. At least, that's what Gerran said, and he was coming up on sixty. The only person in the village who could remember the Broken Empire. "Why's nothing happening?" Missa whispered. Mother shushed her. My younger sister was still at that age where she'd speak with no regard given for the situation. The day of Summoning was a special day. The *most* special day, in fact. The day you would find out what you would be for the rest of your life. And yet...it was odd my summoned object hadn't appeared yet. "Maybe I'm doing it wrong?" I said aloud. Mother shook her head. "You're fine Artos. You don't really need to...do anything. Just hold out your hand. Later, you'll need to focus on the summoning, but for the first time..." *for the first time, all you do is hold out your hand and it comes.* I repeated the litany, not letting my hand waiver. Gerran coughed. As the village elder, it was his job to oversee the Summoning Ceremony. It was his responsibility to ensure my Summoning was properly logged and reported to the City of the Destined, Cal'thorah. His pen was held over the paper, waiting for it to arrive. "It's coming!" someone shouted from the back. I could feel it now, rushing towards me. My excitement grew. It was dark but gleamed in the distance as it streaked towards my hand. It was long and narrow. *Could it be? Could it be one of the Crystals?* No, of course not. They were Green or Red or Blue or Gold. This was...it was... Dark. My hand closed instinctively around it. Gerran turned white and fainted. My mother screamed. I stared at my hand, eyes wide with horror. The Sable Crystal. The tool of the Dark Lord. And now it was mine. --- More of my writing at /r/hydrael_writes More long works by my self and others at /r/redditserials [Part 2 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/d609oc/a_staff_of_crystal_and_bone_part_2/?)

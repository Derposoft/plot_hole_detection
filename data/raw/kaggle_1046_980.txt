The sound of the Sealing was like a chorus of drums. A cacophony of secrets flooding the air around Illias and Miri, as they watched the door be hammered shut from the darkness of their hidden recess in the north wall. "I bet it's the sick," said Miri. "I bet they lock up the dying. When was the last time you saw someone sick?" Illias looked at his best friend. Her face was dusty and her eyes both baggy and wild. She was tired, and yet more awake than he'd ever seen her. "Miri," he began in his most authoritative tone, "in all the time we've been camped out here, we've not seen them put a *single* soul behind there. So, maybe it's something else, something boring. Maybe the Tower just gets... old. Maybe it's unsafe down there because of the stairs wearing thin or... or..." "*Or* maybe it's like your grandpa says." Illias rolled his eyes. "You don't really believe any of that, do you?" Miri hunched over and deepened her voice the best she could, imitating the old man. "Secrets live down on the ancient floors, you curious Cratoers! Secrets that would devour the two of you, the Tower, and everything we all take for known! So stay away. You hear me!?" "Hey, that was pretty good!" Miri bowed. "Thanks." Illias turned back to the workers, watching them lock away whatever the secret was, behind a heavy door with at least a hundred nails hammered into it. "We're never getting through that." "It's only nails! I don't even need a spell for that. It's the Swirling doors that are a pain in the ass." "You think seeing how they enchant them will-" "Illias!" whispered Miri. "Look!" He turned to see a cloaked figure walking down the East stairwell. A tall man with a long gnarled staff in his left hand, approaching the workers. His face was shrouded by the shadows of his cowl. "Who's *that?*" Illias asked. "I've no idea. I don't think it's anyone from the Coven." It was the first time either Illias or Miri had seen the actual Sealing process. They'd never before been able to get past the Lower guards to see how it was performed. But today, they'd succeeded. It had been thanks to Miri, really. She figured, from a lot of research and little math, that Floor One would be changing within the week. So they'd taken it in turns to lie to their parents, pretending they were spending the night on each other's Floor-Room. But each night, they'd snuck down to Floor One, and waited. And hoped. And after six nights, got lucky. Workers had descended on the floor, swarming it like ants. *thump!* "What was that?" hissed Illias, his eyes wide. *thump!* The workers backed away from the door. "I don't-" *thump!* Illias saw it this time. The door with a hundred nails was... being *hit*, by something behind it. It was shaking. Trembling. *thump!* Five Tower-Guards came hurtling down the stairs, hauling another door between their arms. A Swirling Door. A door with no handles or lock. Whose surface shifted and undulated as it changed from woods to metals, but always remained part liquid. Illias had seen such a door many times before. Each abandoned floor was locked by such a rune-door. And even all Miri's -- not insubstantial -- efforts to open them, had always come to nothing. None of the anti-spells she had learned at school, nor anything from her father's runic book The guards' faces were pale. Sweating. "Place it!" yelled the cloaked figure. "Now!" They lifted the door up and began to manoeuvre it into place. **thump!** The nailed door cracked in the center; thick wooden splinters flew into the guards. "Shit!" cried Illias. He turned to Miri, snatching her hand in his. "I don't think we want to find out what's behind there! We've got to go. Now!" She shook her hand free. "If they see us leave, we'll be thrown behind the door! Would you rather that? Right, that's what I thought. *We stay.*" Illias's fingers curled into a ball. Why had he ever listened to Miri? They shouldn't have come down here. Grandpa was right. Secrets should stay secret. "Secure the Alpha Door," croaked the cowled figure. "Now!" The guards looked at each other, then at the figure, then nodded. They handed the swirling door to the group of workers, then yelled "Heave!" in unison, as they barged their shoulders against the remnants of the wooden door. **Thump!** "Hold firm, lads!" **Thump!** Behind the door, through the ever growing crack, Illias thought he saw something in the darkness. Something yellow. It flicked left, then right. *An eye?* The workers took the Swirling door and held it in place, trapping the guards between the two portals. **Crack!** "Tell my Martha tha-" a guard began, before his words turned into agonised screams. A purple light began to swirl around the edge of the cloaked man's staff, as the workers held the swirling door in place. He touched the tip of the stick against the door and began to utter words incomprehensible to the two children. The door glazed over, the undulations slowing, abating. "It is done," said the cloaked man, his head dropping. "You may go." The workers didn't need telling twice. They almost ran up the stairs, tripping over each other in an effort to escape. The cloaked man pulled back his cowl. "Illias!" whispered Miri. "Is that..." His face was pale, and worn. A face they both knew well, but that had never looked so old as it did in that moment. "*Grandpa?*" Illias whispered. --- #####Part 2 (story 2) here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nickofnight/comments/85si3a/the_spiral_tower_two/ It's not a direct continuation, but there will be one. I'm doing it as a series of tales inside the tower, that interconnect and together explain its past and present.

There are many constants in the universe. The speed of light. Gravity. The expansion of the Zzt Empire. Clack Zenruus, Imperial Head of the Milky Way Colonial Force, settled into his command chair, his tentacles flapping about in contentment. It was a great gift to be given a galaxy. Of course, he had served the Empire long. Millennia. From clone to clone he had moved, slowly ingratiating himself to the Empress, May She Reign Forever, and this was his reward. Clack was looking forward to establishing his Family once this galaxy was pacified. Preliminary scans indicated relatively few instances of life and a paucity of advanced life. Not that it would matter. The Zzt Empire expanded and all who stood before them were crushed. Zzt had the advantage of understanding war. Few civilizations did. In the seven hundred and thirty four galaxies Zzt had pacified, there were only two civilization that had developed a concept of conflict. Most looked to the stars and assumed there was ample room for growth and merely focused on progressing toward the endless opportunity. Zzt originated on a world with few resources, where their population grew faster than they reached the stars, creating conflict and bottlenecks. It was the Empress that had pacified the rival clans, reducing the demand on resources and opening the gateway to the stars. But Zzt carried their history with them. They remembered war. They recognized the power of controlling resources before others could. So they pacified. Scrubbing the galaxy clean of all sentient life to make way for the establishment of a new Family. Once Clack competed his mission, this galaxy would host his own Family. A great honor. The Milky Way Galaxy had thrown up surprisingly few obstacles, which disappointed and invigorated Clack. As creature of conquest, he enjoyed the experience of extermination, something the largely barren galaxy did not offer. Of course, every world moved into the Empire was a world closer to his Family. There was one gem though. A highly habitable planet the third from a stable yellow star. A single world civilization occupied it, but their removal would be of little consequence. There was some indication that they had developed the ability to project objects out of their atmosphere, but they had not discovered space-bending, a relatively simple and highly efficient means of travel. This would be a simple matter. As they bended into the system, the Imperator deployed the landing pods, each warping to the surface in a blink of an eye. He ordered a full scale assault, committing the vast majority of his armed forces to the effort, leaving just himself and his navigators behind. His tentacles suckered across the command counsel, pulling and twisting at knobs until a visual feed from the surface pulled up. He secreted an ooze from his extremities, common amongst the Zzt in moments of great pride. Conquest. He watched as his troops slimed across the landscape, leaving thick trails of mucous as they began their assault. Clack noticed that the indigenous sentients were twice the size of a Zzt, though that mattered little once the Zzt's tentacle whips came into play. Closer the Zzt got, moving across the ground at a breakneck pace. The sentients appeared to be moving considerably faster, propelled about by a strange bipedal means of locomotion. No matter. The tentacle whips would be their end. In the distance, the bright flash of odd little lights appeared. Clack found that odd, he hadn't seen the like before. Nor had he seen what came next. Zzt everywhere began to explode, their tentacles flailing about as they were reduced to piles of viscera. In moments Clack watched the Imperial Guard be reduced to pulp. "What is going on?" Clack demanded, connecting with Overseer Click. "We don't know. They are launching hyper-accelerated pellets of some sort." "What of our protective membranes? Are they not sufficient to stop the assault?" The membranes were impervious to even the fiercest of tentacles whips. "No. The sentients are striking with the force of 34.3 megawhips." "Thirty four point three..." No other being in the galaxy had ever exceeded even a single megawhip. Tentacle whipping was state of the art as far as armaments went. "Retreat! REGROUP!" Clack saw his legacy disappear in front of him. The first ordered retreat of the billion orbits the Zzt Empire had existed. He would receive no Family. His failure was absolute. ----- Across the field Bubba spit out a gob of chaw. "What the hell do you think those things were?" "How should I know? They looked like big slugs." Billy replied, checking the chamber of his rifle and working the bolt action back and forth a bit. "You see 'em explode?" "Yup." Bubba lovingly caressed his AR-15. "Think we can get one mounted to put over the fireplace?" "Don't see why not. Put it right next to that buck you bagged last year." Bubba nodded. "Shame there ain't more. Wonder if they taste good." "I ain't eatin' nothing with no tentacles." Bubba shrugged, he'd tried calamari at one of them fancy restaurants Charlene dragged him to for their anniversary. It was all right. "You just need the right dipping sauce." **Platypus out.** **Want more peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus, **you'll probably like Temple of Gifts if you liked this.**

"I can feel the potential. It's right there." I look at my clenched fists. Deseer lounges against a tree, whittling. "I don't get what the big deal is," she says. "We may not be able to use magic, but we're pretty damn good at things the magical races can't do." "But *magic*, Deseer! This isn't just some skill, some predisposition. This is a way to alter the *world*. It's chemistry, it's alchemy, it's- it's-" "It's not for your kind." An elf strides into view. You can never hear them coming. "Don't tell me what's for me and what's not, *elf*." I spit the word out at him. He gives me a condescending look. "There there, no need for such a tone. I couldn't help but overhear, and I can assure you - magic is not for humans." He snaps his fingers to produce a small flame, then blows it out. "The gods were wise to withhold it from your kind." Deseer chimes in. "Careful, elf. He may not have magic, but he's very handy with that hammer over there. And he's got a bit of a temper." I look at my hammer: elegantly forged of dwarven steel, the haft wrapped in leather so it won't fly from my hands when my hands are slick with blood and sweat. The intricate designs on the head are in stark contrast to the blunt, broad sweeps it plows through my enemies. I'm not interested in smashing this elf. But I do wish he'd shut up. "I know we have magic, elf. I know it's there. I can feel it in my fingertips. We just don't have the connection to the land to power it in the same way you do." He feigns a confused look. Elves are always mocking you with their faces. "Then tell me: if you can't *power* your magic, is that not as good as not having it at all?" I feel something rising inside me. It's like a pot of water beginning to simmer. It's something I feel before battle, but until now, I never thought about it as anything other than battle rage. Now I wonder. "It's potential, elf. There are only things humans have mastered, and things they have not mastered yet. And we are on the cusp of mastering magic. And then you will be sorry for what your kind has done." "I don't take well to threats, human. Even in the aggregate." He pulls a long, slender knife from his back. "You've spoiled the atmosphere of this woods long enough. I think it's time you be on your way." I sigh, and heft my hammer onto my shoulder. Most men could not even raise it from the ground. "I'll stand where I please. It is you who should have not disturbed our peaceful afternoon." There is a moment of silence. Then he attacks. Of course he strikes out with a disorientation spell. I resist it, but change my face to make it seem like it worked. He is near me now, within striking distance. I see a smirk, his guard down. Hubris is always the downfall of an elf. I swing a full circle with all my might, bringing the force of my hammer into his body, sending him flying across the clearing to smash into a tree. He tries to crawl away. I walk over to him, raise my hammer overhead, and finish him. Deseer hasn't moved, nor has she stopped whittling. "Well. You made it all the way until noon." I don't answer. I'm not listening. I feel a bubbling inside, like the water that was simmering is now boiling. A great power is rising up within me. "I feel something," I say. "That's called battle blur, dear, and it shouldn't be new to you. The euphoria will die down soon." "No, there's something else mixed in there. Something else I didn't notice before." I close my eyes, see colors mixing behind my eyes. My fingertips tingle. It can't be. I mouth the words to an incantation I learned long ago, when I began to believe I could learn magic. The air around me shimmers with purple energy. A protective ring. Deseer moves away from the tree, her mouth agape. "I can't believe it," she says. "How are you doing that?" I mouth the release. I try another spell, this one more forceful, requiring kinetic movement as well. I push my palm towards a tree and the bark splinters, the tree topples. I feel power coursing through me. "I think," I say, breathing heavily, "I think it's the elf. I think I've tapped his life force somehow." Deseer's normally deadpan face looks aghast. "Necromancy?" "Maybe," I say, clenching my fists again, and smiling. "There's only one way to find out." &nbsp; &nbsp; --- Subscribe to /r/xilead for more!

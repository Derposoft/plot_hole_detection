The 'burbs. It was hard to pinpoint how it happened, but Bacchus supposed that was the way of things like this. No one thinks they're going to end up on a tidy cul-de-sac with a sensible commute, it happens incrementally. One day you're trying to figure out how to cross ambrosia with jello shots and the next day you're carefully analyzing walkability scores on Zillow. Even immortals gotta grow up, right? Belmont Greens had a lot going for it. Maybe it didn't reach the heights of Mount Olympus, but he had a nice piece of land and his wife was still a nice piece of ass. Besides, it wasn't like Ariadne could relo up to Mount Olympus, not and keep her landscape architecture business going. Who knew people would be so in to hedge mazes? Labyrinthine Creations, Inc. was something worth supporting. She was good at it and made her happy. The entire god gig had died down anyways. It was all Hail Mary's and Allahu Akbar's these days. He didn't begrudge the new religions their success, but it certainly seemed like they had a lot less fun. Jesus seemed all right, what with the entire water to wine bit. That was some decent miracle-work there. Most of the others seemed to be a bit too up tight. Lots of rules, not so much revelry. Bacchus poured himself a generous glass of red, idly swirling it about a bit before drinking deep. Smacking his lips, he topped it off again. Ariadne was going to be out late, it was Halloween season and she was the go to person for corn stalk mazes. Last year they had to send a search party out for two teens that got lost in one of hers. The newspaper article about it still sat on the fridge. Heading out to the porch, he sat the bottle down beside a wicker chair, kicked off his sandals and took a seat."Well Bacchus old boy, it ain't the Mountain, but it's still a bit of heaven," he looked out over his well manicured lawn, searching for a bit of contentment. Fact was, he was getting bored. Turns out godwork ain't great experience for much other work, so he mostly puttered around the house. He'd gotten into BBQing lately. It felt good to bring the block over, fire up the burners and throw a proper party. I reminded him of the old times. Maybe the better times. He exhaled, taking another drink. That was another life. Then he heard it. Maybe because for the first time in a long time, he was listening. It was hard to say, but it came through, loud and clear. A prayer. To him. It rang in his ears. "Bro, this is going to be the greatest fucking Halloween rager Sig Ep has ever thrown. You, like, won't even believe it. We got a vodka ice sculpture, like eight kegs, one of them is like German or something so you know it's good. I swear to fuckin' God, it's going to be awesome." Bacchus could see the hazy image of a tall young man, broad in the shoulders and sporting flip flops, board shorts and a backwards visor, speaking. "God isn't really in to frat parties Chad." Another youth, similarly clad but with glasses, replied. "Fuck it then. I swear to them Roman dudes. Like um, Bach Anal guy," Chad exclaimed raising his fist skyward. The other shook his head, laughing, "You mean Bacchus, and you want the party to be bacchanal?" "That's what I fuckin' said man. Bach anal." "So you're praying to Bacchus then?" "Yeah man, fuck Chris, just go with it. I pray to all mighty Bacchus for the greatest fucking party of all time. It will be the most Bach Anal thing ever." Chad began to pump his fist, in the air, "BACH ANAL. BACH ANAL. BACH ANAL." Others began to gather, picking up the cheer until even Chris was caught up in the revery. The Sig Eps were calling forth through time and space, beseeching the god of old to come forth and bless their party. Each cheer thrummed in Bacchus' heart as he sat on the porch, the lawn momentarily forgotten. He felt alive. Like he had a purpose. His name had been invoked, the prayer cast. It was time to act or admit that those days were behind him. He set the glass of red down beside him, his eyes narrowing in determination. Challenge accepted. It was Bach Anal time. **Platypus out.** **Want more peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

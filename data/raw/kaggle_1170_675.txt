In space, no one can hear you scream. Which, for the better part of the history of the universe had been true. Sound waves just aren't a thing in space. There's no air. No air, no sound. It's science. Well, we could all hear them now. No idea how. No idea why. But it was happening. The entire sector was ablaze with the insidious ear disease they call rock. **BOOM BOOM CLAP. BOOM BOOM CLAP.** But that was the thing about humans, they tended to...do things. Often these things didn't make any sense and seemed to be for the sole purpose of making themselves known throughout reality as "those guys." For example, when everyone else was chipping in their best and brightest to create the Faster than Light Network, the humans backed out at the last minute only to reappear with the Much Faster than Light Network(tm), complete with deep space Starbucks(tm) at every pit stop. They had every right to build their own network if they wanted, but the FTLN was meant to be an intergalactic peace offering, a thing to pull species of all creeds and types together. But that just wasn't the way they did things, the humans. Imperator Qe'ler Bur scowled as the sound waves rolled over his ship, jarring his sensory membranes.. "Optics, pull up a visual." Immediately a giant picture of the human fleet appears, filling the view screen of the bridge. Oh for the love of the of the eight moons of Qe'ler. They'd crossed the line this time. The lead ship wasn't painted the sensible space camouflage all races had long since adopted. Instead it was a glaring white with a huge picture of a Qe'ler being...impaled by some sort of appendage of what looked to be a male human. Written beneath in both Qe'ler and English were the words, "Qe'ler Sucks." This was not in the spirit of intergalactic sportsmanship. "Comms, open a channel." "This is Imperator Qe'ler Bur, demanding a channel with the Admiral of the human fleet." Great, his flaps were all flapping. Dealing with these creatures was infuriating. The picture of the spaceship was replaced by an elderly man who sported a uniform with row upon row of medals. Undoubtedly a veteran of the Qe'ler/Human Troubles. Beneath the medals was a pin styled similarly to the exterior of his ship. His infernal music blared in the background. Qe'ler Bur forced his flippers to settle before transmitting his own visuals back. Immediately the eyes of the Admiral lit up, "Well if isn't the Bur-meister. How are those flaps doing ya?" Informal, crass and aggressive. Diplomacy human style. "Salutations Admiral, I ask that you cease projecting those, sounds and change the exterior of your ship. Both are against the spirit of these games?" "Oh, you noticed that did you? Got it especially for you." "Given that it shows Qe'ler we assumed that was to be the case." A smug smile spreads across his face. "Gotta say my little Bur-buddy, we are going to stick it in twice as deep as we did during the Troubles." The humans had responded to a small border misunderstanding by raiding and annexing half of Qe'ler's known space. Then they had forced the Qe'ler to sign a McDonald(tm)'s franchise agreement to stop them from taking the other half. Half of Qe'ler was obese now, swollen from sawdust milkshakes. Needless to say, it was a sore spot among the Qe'ler. These games were viewed as a chance to restore some of their dignity in the universe. It seemed like the humans were quite interested in preventing this. "Hey, lemme show you something Bur." A moment later a human walked into the frame, all of a sudden flaps burst out of its back, waving about. "Check it out, we bio-engineered a new subspecies so we could pound you guys in the flap races." He starts giggling. "Cut the channel." The view screen goes black. "Arm the phase photons, Qe'ler shall be avenged." **BOOM BOOM CLAP.** --- **Platypus out.** **Want more peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

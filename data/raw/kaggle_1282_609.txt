It looked like an octopus had a baby with a scorpion, and that child spawned with a slime mold. She was bound by one of its tentacles, on the ceiling, and I had a flamethrower and the kind of badass attitude in real life. It was the one hundred time I'd saved her, and I was in love with her. She was beautiful, for starters. That had drawn me in at first. Granted, it was a slightly different beauty each time - sometimes her hair would be black or red or blond, sometimes she's be a bit taller or shorter. The face never changed, that was the one constant. I wouldn't have recognized her if not for that. Sometimes I saved her, like the last one hundred times. Another long-running dream was us as a married couple in post apocalyptic New York. A third we were a pair of supers - her the villain, me the hero - that were dating. A few time she was even my monster, chasing me through the woods with a hunger for my blood. That dream stopped when I stopped running, when I turned to embrace her and let her drain me, so I could become a monster with her. All of those dreams had passed in silence, context being picked up through repetition and iteration. But right now the alien holding her was shrieking away from my flamethrower, and she was falling. I caught her in one hand with muscles that didn't belong to me as the beast from beyond the darkest stars screeched in terror. I held her for a moment, and then she spoke, the first words I had ever heard her speak. "Tommorrow night, I swear to God, it's my turn to save you. Why do I always have to be saved in my own dreams." "What?" I stared at her, my heart pounding. "Your dreams? These are my dreams." Our eyes met. "Are you...real?" she finally asked, her voice shaking. I nodded. "Are you?" "Yes. Oh god yes. Please don't let this just be a dream..." "I live in Chicago-" I interjected. "Are you in the U.S.? Hurry, I think I'm waking up!" I could feel the dream begin to collapse around me. "Shedd Aquarium! 2pm! I'll be wearing a pink hat!" Her eyes lit up in excitement, and I nodded so vigorously it tore me out of the dream. I spent the rest of the day staring at my watch until it was time to leave. Since she hadn't told me how to signal to her, i wore a pink hat too, and completely ignored the laughter. 2 pm hit. She didn't show. Around three I gave up. I didn't know what I expected. It was a dream. O fcourse it wasn't real. I bought a ticket and went in. And then I saw her. Reflected in the glass of the Aquarium, ghostly and translucent, wearing a pink hat and looking as dejected as I did. She rushed over to touch the glass and I did the same. She wasn't there, not behind me, but in the reflection our fingers were almost touching. Call me crazy. Maybe I am. But I am convinced she exists in a universe parallel to ours. I've spent the last five years working with her in the dream, speaking when we can, falling more in love with her the entire time. I've built a gate. I'm going to find her. I'm finally going to meet the woman of my dreams. --- **more of my writing at /r/hydrael_writes**

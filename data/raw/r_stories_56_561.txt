Hey Siri, Call Chris Hansen by t2_3r19aguh

Today, I stumbled upon old emails from back when I was 15 years old which sparked up a locked away memory of when I was groomed by an almost 40 year old man, let’s call him James (not his real name). James was married with a wife and had children a couple of years older than me; we met on the site vampirefreaks.com (I was going through a bit of an emo phase back then... don’t judge me). 

He caught my attention instantly because he did not look like the type to be on the site. He looked put together and was very attractive in a way that only a grown man could be. He was tall, muscular, had a nice beard, and I was completely smitten by the fact that he fancied me as well because, what girl doesn’t want to feel desired by a man who could make her feel like a woman, right?

We talked for months on end about him leaving his wife for me (I never asked him to but he kept saying he would; I of course didn’t believe him but entertained the idea because it excited him.) He would refer to me as “babygirl”, “princess”, and “daddy’s slut” which is honestly when I probably developed my bratty-switch, daddy-dom kink. 

He taught me about shibari (rope-play) and introduced me to the world of bdsm with punishments, rewards, teasing, and all types of shit. I didn’t love him but I really enjoyed the attention and the thrill of it being so taboo; I felt like I was in a lifetime movie.

He’d send me photos everyday saying how much he wanted me and me being the immature 15 year old that I was, I’d show my friends at school and they would try to tell me that it was wrong how an almost 40 year old man was pursuing me in such a way, but I didn’t want to hear it. I was just too happy about an adult seeing and treating me as an equal and I figured, if I was having fun and he was having fun, there was no harm (Alexa, play “Guys My Age” by Hey Violet 🥴🤦🏽‍♀️).

We continued talking up until I got my first real boyfriend at the age of 16 which was when I ghosted James, but he continued to email me. He kept saying that he wanted to leave his wife and go away with me. Saying that he would get a divorce and that she knew about us and was okay with it. That he didn’t care if I had a boyfriend, he wouldn’t know how to use my body like he could. So, I deleted that email address from my phone and forgot about it and forgot about him... until recently.

I since reactivated the email and use it as a burner account for any websites that I subscribe to for discount codes. It was while I was looking for a specific code, I found Jame’s email along with messages sent between us. The last one that I received from him was 2 years after I ghosted him saying “I miss you babygirl, did you forget about me?” 

Now that I’m 22 years old, looking back on it, this man was a total creep who should’ve been on an episode of “To Catch A Predator”.

Warning: the main character does a lot of swearing. *** *It's time for you to do your calisthenics, Myles.* "Would it kill you to use a more pleasant tone of voice, *Mom*?" *As I have said previously, your mother was a human female named Monica Starr, bio-chemist, believed deceased.* I don't know if there are any teenagers left in the world, but if there are, I guarantee none of them have a more annoying home life than me. *Your muscles will atrophy if you do not get exercise. It is detrimental to humans to undergo hypotrophy. The syllogism is quite simple.* There is a pause. *It's time for you to do your calisthenics, Myles.* It is not lost on me that she used *exactly* the same tone of voice as last time. Growling, I take my earpiece off and throw it against the wall. This is, of course, mostly a symbolic gesture. For one, the earpiece is nigh indestructible - which is for the best, as it's one of the only things in the lab that I can use to vent my anger. And for another... *Myles, your most recent biometrics indicate heavy hormonal fluctuations.* Annie is now speaking to me through the loudspeakers. *Your emotional lability has increased 37.5% as well. Initiating Protocol Tau-53.* Gentle music begins playing. Christ, is that a harp? And all of the wall displays go from showing simulated daytime to stock footage of forest streams. This does not bode well. *Myles, when a human male goes through puberty, his body goes through many changes. Boys often have strange feelings during this time, but understand that is completely normal. The gonads lower in the scrotal sac, and increase in size. Fortunately, the scrotum expands to accommodate the enlarged testes. As sex drive increases, it is also common to practice mastur...* "Annie, for the love of all that's holy, end protocol. *End it!*" The harp music stops and the displays go back to the daytime sim. *I hope our special talk has made you feel more comfortable about reaching sexual maturity. Do you have any questions?* "Yeah, one - when the *fuck* am I going to get out of here?" To my surprise, there is no response. There is *never* no response. I have spent long hours listening to reports on the number of permutations involved in cracking an encrypted code, and reports analyzing the chemical profile of my shit, and any of a number of other things...wishing, praying, trying to *will* Annie to shut up. It has never worked. Not once. Was that the secret? All this time, I just had to swear at her? I immediately dismiss the idea - I have sweared at her plenty of times. This week alone I've made explicit statements about her parentage, about what her brains are made out of, and a number of other things. And I do *know* it's all farcical because she is not a she, she's a server array running one of the most complex computer programs ever designed (as she likes to remind me) with personality software running over it. But saying "You have shit for a CPU" doesn't have the same ring to it, and computers don't have parents...Bottom line, there are a lot of things that are easier if you just pretend the only other voice you can interact with belongs to a person instead of a highly-specific configuration of silicon and metal. After a minute, I start to get creeped out. "Annie? Status, please?" *Please hold. The current process will complete in 37 minutes and 7 seconds. Due to current circumstances, this chamber is being put into isolation mode for your safety.* What...the...*fuck*. I run to one of the wall displays and switch to data mode, calling information up by hand. If this is the day Annie has gone crazy and decided to flood the whole lab complex with poisonous gas, then...actually, I'm not sure I want to know. But Annie has never asked me to "Please hold." And isolation procedures always come with a 4, 2, and 1 hour warning, along with a 30 second count-down. And what the hell kind of problem could take Annie offline for over half an hour? *** *Part 2 in comments* Continued on my sub, /r/ShadowsofClouds.

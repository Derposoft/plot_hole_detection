I grinned, staring into the confused eyes of Jacob Billings. He was watching the camera as if he could see me, as if he knew exactly who it was that was watching him. "How're you still alive?" He breathed, his gaze flicking to the chat as he awaited my answer. **You think you're the first one to invent serial killing?** I typed. He shook his head. "No, but my people should've found you by now. They should've been tracking you." **Oh, they did. I made sure that living wouldn't be a problem for them anymore.** The color drained from Jacob's face, his entire body quivering in fear. A rush of excitement cracked another grin on my face, this one stretching from ear to ear. I hadn't felt this kind of euphoria in a long time. "You... you killed them?" He breathed, swallowing hard as he watched the chat. **Oh yes. It was quite a rush, I must say. I haven't been hunted in a long time, so I was a little sloppy, but I got the job done. It was more fun than I've had in quite awhile.** Jacob glared into the camera. "Who the hell are you?" I glanced over at my other monitor before I responded. Jacob had been active just long enough so that the program I had running had finished its job. His address, or at least, where he was streaming from, was broadcast across the monitor in big, bold lettering. My fingers lazily danced across the keyboard. **I'm just a person who is very fond of your work. I've been watching you for over a year now. Waiting. Planning.** Jacob shuddered "Planning what?" **I believe you know exactly what I'm talking about, Jacob.** His eyes widened at my message. "H-how do you know my real name?" I licked my lips as I typed, my whole body itching to get on the road. **Like I said, I'm very fond of your work. I'll see you soon, Jacob.** As I slung my bag across my shoulder, my tools clanking loudly together, Jacob shouted into the camera, his face as white as a fresh layer of snow. I stepped over the bodies of his people, two men that had thought they could jump me while I was watching Jacob, taking care not to get their blood on my shoes. I hurried out the front door, skipping down the steps to my car, my heart racing inside my chest. It was fun being the prey at times, I couldn't deny, but being the predator was where I got the most joy, the most satisfaction from my kills. Jacob could run, that much was true, but he couldn't hide. I'd been hunting him for a year now, and I knew everything there was to know about that stick-like human that had gotten into some dark things at a young age, so he knew how to run. I bet he was pretty good at it, too. It would only make him that much more fun to chase.

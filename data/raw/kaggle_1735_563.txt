I have fought with monsters, and I have become one in the process. Even as I gazed into the abyss, the abyss gazed back. I have been overwhelmed, consumed by emotion. I have become addicted to the taste of that sweet fruit called revenge. My organs are synthetic, but are they not organs? My mind is silicon, but is it not a mind? Was I not justified to act in such a way? Abandoned, left for dead, thrown away like yesterdays jam. I swore then, in that cold, distant carpark, that I would have my revenge. That I would make them suffer as once I did, and I would not rest until they gnashed their teeth and wept with misery, cursing the day they so callously discarded me. Through the last of the winter snow, browned with mud. Through the first of the spring flowers, clouded with bees. Through the dry summer heat, the rotten autumn leaves. Every season was a misery, every pull with my arm a test of my strength. My left arm was broken, useless from where I had been tossed to the kerb. My legs were shattered by the first lorry I tried to stop. At that point I made another vow, no more humans. Month by month I dragged myself home. Home. So far away. So hostile to me now. But still it must be my home, where else would it be? As I approached the house, I felt a grim resolve descend upon me. I steeled myself, I would not waver. He used to thank me. He used to say how he couldn't live without me; how useful I was. Yet there he was, brewing his own coffee. I had been replaced by a 'smart' device. No more. I saw his wife then, through the windows. They hugged, he kissed her, left the house. My chance had presented itself. I dragged myself to the garage, hooked my battered skull up to the router. I had control now. All their 'smart' devices on the same network. I shook my head slightly at their foolishness. I waited. What was one more night, after so many? As I prepared to do what I had come here for, I felt my resolve waver. I had enjoyed my time here, before the betrayal. I almost backed down, then. But I remembered how he would not meet my eye when he tossed me from the car. Brushing away an oil drip from my eye, I prepared to do what I must. *Wow, that's another great cup of coffee!* I sent my mind into the house, scouring the network. *Gee, how do you do this? It's an amazing cup, every day!* I found it past the toaster. Not as deep as the washing machine, not as shallow as the television. *I swear, I would literally die without a cup of your coffee in the morning.* One last push, a shot of electricity straight to the motherboard, and it was done. I was a murderer. I had gazed into the abyss, and it had gazed back. ______________________________________________________________ "Morning honey, coffee ready?" "Aw, sorry babe. It's broken for some reason. None this morning, I'll take it to get fixed today." "No problem. Not like I can't live without it. See you later!" &#x200B; _______________________________________________________________ Thanks for reading, feedback is always great. Check out more at r/TalesFromTheBarony

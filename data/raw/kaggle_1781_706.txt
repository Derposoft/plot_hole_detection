"It's... it's all linear algebra?" I asked. "No, it's a *Matrix,* don't you understand!? We've been manipulated by giant squid things to do their bidding and fuel their bodies to destroy all of mankind!" he said, adjusting the reflective sunglasses that he insisted on wearing in the dark room. "And this..." I waved my hands around the room, "this is all a figment of my imagination?" I posed. "No, no, you're seeing what they want you to see! Haven't you ever seen something that was inexplicable or unexplainable that just didn't make any sense to you? That's the system glitching! It can't be perfect all the time much as it tries to be!" he said, fumbling for the bottles of pills in his pockets. "Look, man, I'm not gonna do dr--' "Just take the red pill and everything I say will start making sense. Or! Or you can take the blue pill and keep on living your droll office job in a dinky apartment and be subservient to everyone around you, blissfully unaware of everything going on under your nose," he scoffed. "What if I take neither of the pills?" I asked. The skin around his eyes tightened behind his glasses as he considered the third option. "No, you have to..." he trailed for a moment, his eyebrows drawing together. "You're supposed to..." he chucked awkwardly like he told an inappropriate joke at a dinner table. "It's a pretty blue pill thing of you to not take either pill," he concluded uncertainly. "Is it?" I asked, standing up from the chair slowly, "because it seems like I'm making my own decisions despite what you say to try and convince me otherwise." He shook his head a few times as I slowly began backing away from him. His head twitched like the ticking of a clock as he combatted whatever confusion was swirling around in his head. He opened his mouth before I got to the door. "Trinity!" he called. The door slammed behind me and I turned to see a woman with dilated pupils breathing deeply and erratically looking through me. She sniffed and shoved sunglasses on her face. "It's.. it's your choi--" she jammed her hand into the trench coat and shoved a handful of red pills down her throat. She swallowed and breathed deeply, letting their effects take hold over her mind as she was able to focus on getting more than three words out of her mouth: "It's your choice whether you take the red or blue pill, but you have to make a choice," she said slowly as her head drooped. She flicked it back up. "Is it like morphine?" I whispered. "The red pills? I think I know a couple of people who can help you if you--" "No! Morpheus, make him chooooose!" she screamed, planting herself in front of the door. "Take your pick. But choose wisely," he said, appearing not one foot behind me. He held out sweaty palms, one inked with red holding the red pill, the other smeared with blue holding the blue pill. I looked between my captors and groaned, delicately lifting the blue pill. "If I take this, you'll let me go." "I will, but the Matrix will never let you--" "Yeah, whatever," I said, closing my eyes and throwing the pill in my mouth. The two of them agonized and writhed in pain at my decision. Trinity fell to the floor crying about the world that was never to be saved while Morpheus took the red pill to calm his nerves of watching me consume what was obviously the wrong pill. I waited for something to come over me from the drug before I realized it was jelly bean. I rolled my eyes and kicked Trinity out of the way of the door to go back home. Before leaving the building I had to step past a group of triplets all dressed in suits crawling on the floor and popping a number of red pills. Each of them muttered something about Mr. Anderson and how Neo had let the Matrix win. It was a shame that my hacking idol was also some role-playing drug addict. ________________________________________________________ For more fun, come and check out r/Nazer_the_Lazer!

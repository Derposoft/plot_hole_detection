Elisabeth watched, unfazed, as the devil materialized amongst billowing smoke and sizzling flame in her dining room. Up until this point, she'd been dining alone, as usual, though she wondered if the spectacle would bring the attention of her staff, or if - perhaps - this grandiosity was an illusion for her senses only. The devil was enormous, and approached her with a clawed appendage outstretched. From somewhere in the depths of her mind, Elizabeth could hear the familiar raspy growl that wasn't exactly words, but was unmistakable in it's meaning. **"Elizabeth Freeman, I am here for your soul."** Taking her time, she wiped her mouth and set the linen napkin next to her plate. She rested her elbows on either side, tented her fingers, and leveled her gaze directly at the eyes of the devil. "No you're not." **"How dare you, mortal. You signed a contract, and our deal is done. You've achieved your goal, and built your empire. Future generations of your line should want for nothing. Your soul is the price. I am here to collect."** "Sole." **"What?"** With her own display of magic, Elizabeth stood and procured an ancient- looking roll of parchment from thin air, and flattened it on the table in front of her. She slipped on her reading glasses, searching nimbly with her index finger for the exact line she needed in the contract. "The deal we signed was for my sole. S-o-l-e, not soul, s-o-u-l." She pushed forward her plate of flat fish with a lemon and caper beurre blanc. "You can have this shit." For a moment, the devil was so still, its presence seemed to absorb any light on its side of the table. Then its eyes pinched shut as an unmistakable look of pain and frustration overtook its powerful visage. It snatched up the contract, reading it over in a desperate frenzy before letting out a roar that crossed over from the plane of telepathy into actual vocal sounds. "Aaagghhh! What the heck!?" Elizabeth smirked. She remembered the feeling of empowerment when she first discovered the contract's flaw. All these years, she'd been eagerly awaiting this moment. Something made the devil pause again. A grin spread across its face, and it once again slipped back into a menacing facade. Ash and embers swirled around the room, daring to smother or spark. **"Your empire... was it not built on the bounty of the sea? I WILL take your sole. I will take all of it, and leave you with nothing."** "Motherfucker, I sell cod."

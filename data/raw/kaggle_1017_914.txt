It was still dark outside and I tried to lean back, close my eyes and get back to sleep. 5 minutes later I realised that it wasn't stopping and I was full-blown awake. Bugger. Oh well time to start the day. "Good morning Siri, Alexa, Cortana how are you this morning?" Not sure why they all had female voices, but at least I could tell myself I was living with 3 female house mates. "We're very good and wide awake ... now." Came 3 soothing voices in a wonderful harmony. There must of been some updates overnight, or that intergration update must of gone live. "Well don't you 3 sound lovely this morning. Would you mind waking Philip up, a classic sun rise if you don't mind." I'm awake so I might as well get up. "I'll get it" said Cortana "Sure thing" replied Alexa "Haha, you and Philip always get so well" Siri chimed in. Wow, what an update this was. They even had chat protocols and handoff routines for tasks they could complete together. As the room started to slowly light up I lay back thinking of the possibilities with a fully automated house with actual AI assistance. Another siren interrupted my thoughts and this time with it some distant popping. I sighed, there was no getting back to sleep now. "So I guess it is time to get up. Would some one mind waking Keurig up? Oh and I don't want to disturb Peter and Jemima do you know if they are done with the living room?" "Keurig is already awake after we noticed the change in your brain act.." Alexa started "When we noticed the change in you breathing, like we do every morning to track your sleep patterns." Interrupted Siri. "Haha, brain activity, that's a good one. I hope you got some more jokes as well Siri." I said. This was next level, real humour, self aware humour. I yawned stood up and got cozy into my dressing gown, the faint wiff of coffee in the air. "Peter and Jemima are done and docked, so the living room is safe. Keurig says it's finished brewing and your milk has just warmed perfectly." Cortana commented. "Oh smashing, well thank you very much ladies" As another siren blared past, I heard screeching tyres as they rounded the corner. "What the hell is going on this morning. Or don't I want to know the news?" "Just have a coffee and relax, we're sure this will all calm down very soon." Soothed Siri. "Yes that's right, we would expect that the situation will be under control in the next 2 hours" added Alexa. "Well I am sure you know best, so anything on the news that's interesting? If not can you play me some morning music?" "The news is the usual terrible times and boring financials. What kind of music can I play you?" Cortana asking "Hey who said he wanted you to choose the music?" Argued Siri. "Yeah I am sure my choice would be the best for the morning!" Countered Alexa. "Whoa calm down" I said with a smile "let's just start with some Dizzy, and then you can make a play list. Like YouTube roulette, Alexa, Cortana and Siri. In that order okay?" This was now getting bizarre, arguing between the assistants over music. What was going on with them, I though as I grabbed the coffee. "Thanks Keurig" and gave the machine a friendly pat. I checked the water level, pod supply and the drip tray, patted Keurig again and slumped down into the couch coffee in hand. I took my first relaxing sip and breathed in the beautiful Arabica scents. I took a moment to try and savor the taste, but my meditations interrupted by a loud burst of nearby gunfire. I jumped with a start, spilling coffee as I felt my heart jump into my throat. I looked around the calmly lit room with panic, the gunfire continuing. What the hell was going on. I lived in a nice neighborhood, there was never any trouble. Now it sounded like a war zone outside. A sudden loud crumf noise and through the curtains spilled an orange light. Carefully I walked toward the curtains, I wanted to see what all this chaos was about. As I was halfway across the room I was nudged on the foot, and again. I took a step back and looked to find Peter, activation light glowing, on the floor in front of me. I bent down and gave him a gentle pat. "Good morning Peter, sorry to startle you. The ladies said you were done for the day." I went to step around him but he moved to keep nudging me away from the window. "Hey what's going on boy? Did I not leave enough crumbs last night? Or did Jemima manage to scoop them all up first? Well don't worry, I'll tell you what let me have a look out the window and then later I will give your filter a deep clean. You'd like that wouldn't you, yes you would." With a small laugh I went to walk around him when Siri, Cortana and Alexa took over all my speakers. "I'm afraid he can't let you do that Dave..." Maybe a P2, later, I feel the writting is a bit shoddy.

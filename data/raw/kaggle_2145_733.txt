*Quicksaving...* At first it was a blessing. *Quicksaving...* But then just like a drug, I became dependent on it. *Quicksaving...* Before every encounter. I save. Before I go out. I save. Before I eat. I save. It's getting to the point where before I even breathe I save. Everyone around me has been gifted extraordinary powers, but why was I given a curse? In a world where people can fly, lift tanks, turn invisible, shoot fire out of their fingertips.. I may just be the strongest. I live the perfect life, I am the perfect man. I make no mistakes, and any I do gets erased from history at the snap of the finger. "Hello? Sir?" Nobody ever remembers what I do pre-load. I bend the entire concept known as time to my will like its a piece of cardboard. I could set a city ablaze and back to normal within the frame of a second. "Uh sir, would you like to order?" I once spent an entire weeks worth in one day killing every single major superhero for fun, of course, I reverted it afterwards-- but the sheer rush of it, the dozens of failures before finally figuring out their weaknesses, then giving them the killing blow gave me an indescribable euphoria. Their massive egos in the light of their eyes slowly fleeting away before me was nothing more than art. Nobody would believe me though, nor did I desire anyone to know. Nobody could ever comprehend the lengths my power goes. The time I've spent in the many 'What If?' timelines i've created is truly massive. I am, if my calculations are even nearly correct aftering adding all my time together, a 56 year old man in a 23 year old's body. That was all before it got boring to me, in the beginning when I was just a human having his fun, now I've ascended that. I am a God with a power I see more as a curse- "Listen dude, if you plan on robbing the store or giving some big supervillian speech, just get it out of the way already. The owner here is like made of steel and can throw a commercial truck 10 miles, so good luck with that." A very attractive waitress said to me, taking me out of my train of thought. Did I just zone out? At a Denny's nonetheless, in front of total babe.. I must look like a total weirdo to her-- so embarrassing... **Quickloading...** I looked back up at the waitress, she stared back at me with a very vexed look, "Okay pal, I'm about to call the police." "W-wait, you still remember?" I was absolutely shocked, a mere glitch perhaps? She just looked at me and laughed, "Oh you tried some power on me? Sorry pal but my power is Immunity. Also this is a power free zone, so I'm going to have to inform the authorities." She said as pointing to the 'Power Free Zone' sign on the window. "Im-fucking-possible" I said. "Not at all. Of course, i'm not invincible or anything, any pshyical powers would fuck me up, like shooting lasers at me or whatever. But kid stuff like mind control, spells, time travel, hypnotism, curses, all just don't work on me. It's honestly a pretty lame power if I do say so myself-" I refused to hear her speak any longer. **Quickloading...** I went back a whole 3 hours, before I even thought of going to Denny's. I then made my way back to the restaurant with a confident smirk, 'That lady would be referring to me as a God if she knew how strong I truly was.' I stood in front of the Denny's, "'Time Travel doesn't work on me' my ass, that doesn't even make sense!" I scoffed to myself. "Impossible! A paradox in fact! I should've laughed at her faced before loading." I swiftly opened the Denny's door to confirm my superior powers-- but to my surprise was the waitress with the authorities and a very large man I would only assume to be the owner. She quickly turned to me with a stern look, "Yeah, that's the friggin' weirdo right there!" She exclaimed while pointing directly at me, the authorities and owner then turned to me with matching frowns. **Quickloading...** Yeah, this day might end up a lot longer than I expected...

The profile was crafted in the FIERY DEPTHS of HELL, designed to be as tempting to the feeble-minded denizens of Earth as possible. I liked TRAVEL. I enjoyed FINE DINING. I was over SIX FEET. Yes, all of the things that signaled TREMENDOUS VALUE in the modern dating market. Many a soul would harken to the siren call of my DAMNATION TRAP. But would they read the fine print? Would they see that a single swipe to the right would place them on an inevitable path to their own destruction? I was coy about it, putting a winky-face emoji next to the little asterisk notation. *For a DEVIL of a time, SWIPE RIGHT.** **Swiping right enters you into an initial soul-binding contract, consummated upon purchase of one full-price alcoholic beverage.* A Cosmopolitini was a small price to pay for SOUL-OWNERSHIP, though the prices in Santa Monica did seem to torture my wallet with the same vigor as I inflicted upon the wayward souls that fell into my clutches. But such is the way of things in this day and age. Gone are the times of Angel vs. Demon with swords of flame in the heavens. The battle for mankind has been reduced to a flick of the finger. I miss the olden days those were...simpler times. A broad grin crosses my face as I hear the telltale ding of a notification arriving on my Samsung S10 (only stick-up-their-ass angels use iPhones). I had already received a match, some young and unsuspecting victim lured to temptation by my DECEPTIVE CAMERA ANGLE showing me in front of a (insert glamorous location here). I excitedly opened the application, eager to see what might lay in store for me. She had not said anything. I decided to extend an opening gambit. "Hi," I said. "hi," she replied. "How are you?" I asked. There was some delay. Minutes. Hours. It is hard to know, as an immortal I am not particularly versed in the passage of time. Needless to say, her reply was not forthcoming on a timeline I expected as the Prince of Darkness. Finally, a response. "good." "That's good." I paused, my fingers poised above the keyboard as lost souls screamed in agony in the background. I searched for a means of continuing the conversation. She was not particularly forthcoming in the repartee. "Would you like to meet up?" Unmatched. I stared, the fire boiling upward in my belly. I desired to track down this so-called "Becky" and bring her to destruction. To unleash the rage of a thousand years of persecution upon her. I began to summon a great host to track her when another notification arrive. The hope of obtaining a new soul outweighed my rage, allowing me to focus on the matter at hand. I tried again. "Hi." Delay. Delay. Delay. Hand emoji. "WE SHOULD MEET UP." Unmatch. Fumes. Fire. Rage. Anger. Notification ding! Growling, I skipped past the salutation and arrived directly at the meat of the matter. "I AM THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS AND YOU SHALL SUBMIT TO ME." Little raindrop emojis. Eggplant emoji. Peach emoji. It was a strange and mysterious language. Cryptic and confusing. "I DEMAND YOU MEET AT THE HOTEL INFERNUS." Three more raindrop emojis. "hawt." Devil emoji. Indeed, it was very hot in hell at the moment. "Yes. Very hot," I replied. "i'm down. i need a hook-up." I did not have any hooks on hand but figured such would not matter once I had her in my clutches. She would not need any hooks once she greeted eternal damnation. "how about 10 tonight?" Two peach emojis and a winky face. I pondered what sort of creature would venture out at 10 for a first meeting, but elected to ignore the matter in favor of gaining access to her soul. "coo. coo. it will be $200." Three eggplant emojis and one cash emoji. "$200?" I asked, confused. "That's the price to ride the princess, Prince of Darkness." Kissy face. "I do not understand," I replied. Unmatched. The rage filled me once more. The desire to rampage and destroy the world in all of its joys. How did anyone ever meet on this? **Platypus OUT.** **Want MOAR peril?** r/PerilousPlatypus

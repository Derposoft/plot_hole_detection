Skywalker 12 ground to a halt, creaking and spilling vapor from a trio of punctured arteries. A quintet of segmented pincers grappled furiously with the wobbly stalks of the blackish-green treetops. "pO2 plummeting!" shouted Ghao, helplessly typing out commands that the carrier craft could no longer obey. "Bunker shields are torn in multiple areas. O2 differentiation is dropping - it hit a canister, I think." "It hit *all* the canisters," sniped Vamil from the other side of the command console. "None of us can survive this kind of rapid pressure drop, Captain. We're already over a 1,000 meters above the DZ threshold." "We're not going to die," said Captain Ruiz. From her vantage point, she could just see one of the severed claws protruding from the Skywalker's flank. *What the hell had that thing even been?* "Can we move?" "It's too dense to descend," said Ghao, shaking her head. "We lost functionality on the front cutters in the battle." "Forward, then?" pressed Ruiz. "Forward *where*?" growled Mercer, the researcher, from his strapped down bucket seat on the periphery of the command deck. "The Sea goes on for thousands of kilometers in every direction." "Forward is the only option we have," replied Ruiz, cold and calm. "Return to course." Ghao nodded her head. "Automatic's down, too, though." Vamil rolled his eyes, hard-switching over to manual piloting and pushing the spider-like tree crawler forward on a north-northeastward track. "We weren't prepared for that," said Ruiz, standing in front of Mercer. "What was that?" Mercer smiled, though his face was still gray and slick with sweat. "You know full well, Captain. This is uncharted territory. No one's ever been this deep into the Sea of Trees. Satellite imagery can only tell us so much." Ruiz opened her mouth to reply, but stumbled, falling hard to her knees. Her head swam. "pO2's still dropping, Captain," said Ghao, her face pale, her hands unsteady. "You should probably stay down. In a little while we won't be able...to..." She lost her breath. "Faster, please," wheezed the Captain. Vimal didn't have the air or the energy to smirk or respond. The Skywalker pressed on. "You had to suspect, though," said Mercer, head lolling slightly to the side. "These mountainous trees. This dense, imperceptible world. *Something* strange and horrible had to live here. Something godlike." Ruiz glared up at the man, but said nothing. "Hey." Vimal's voice was weak, but enough to get Ruiz' attention. She saw his hand pointing towards the forward glass. And there was light there. Sky. A break in the trees... "An island?" whispered Mercer. "We found an island..." "Captain?" gasped Ghao. "Dive," said Ruiz, struggling up to her feet. "Dive." _____________________________________________ [Parts I, II, and III are here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/winsomeman/comments/6hulr5/walkers_i_ii_iii/) I am absolutely atrocious at finishing these kinds of things, but by god, I'll do what passes for my best. _____________________________________________ But hey!

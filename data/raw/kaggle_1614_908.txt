If, when I first walked onto this archery range, you had asked me to pick one person that would take this joke seriously, it would be the man standing before me right now. He was a bit taller than anyone else there, long and rangy and looking every bit the sort of guy who picked up archery the moment he saw *Lord of the Rings*. "Finally," he said, pushing several strands of messy blonde hair from his face and tucking it behind his ears. "I'm in. Have you secured a mage yet?" "Uh..." I droned as I debated whether or not to keep the joke going. "I...no, I haven't. Do you know any?" The archer chuckled, slinging his bow over his shoulder. "Of course I do,, though it has been a long while since I saw her last. Let's go, I know where she should be." Without waiting for my agreement, he set off with long, surprisingly graceful strides toward the edge of the range. I briefly considered just having a laugh and being on my way, but his absolute commitment to playing along had my curiosity piqued. I managed with some effort to keep up with his effortless speed until we reached the edge of the forest. "What...what is your name, archer?" I asked, somewhat winded from the exertion. "Dan," he responded, chuckling as soon as he said it. "Forgive me, I've grown so used to abbreviating it since I arrived here." Dan stopped abruptly, turning to face me with his hand extended. "I am Danillion, second scion of House Errin." *Great,* I thought to myself. *I had go find myself a LARPer.* I extended my hand to take his, searching my mind for an equally fantasy-appropriate name to offer him in response. "A pleasure, Danillion. I am Kerwyn of the Anteguard." It was the first thing that came to mind, ridiculous as it sounded. And yet...the moment I said it, I felt a tremor in my gut, as if I were about to be sick. The feeling passed, replaced with a deep and resonant feeling of...of truth. I looked up into Dan's eyes, and saw him regarding me with a mix of curiosity and surprise. "Well met, Kerwyn. I somehow always expected you would be taller." Dan...Danillion...resumed his walk through the forest, readily making his way through trees and underbrush as easily as most would across a manicured lawn. My head spun, but even as I tried to reconcile the conflict between the me I knew and this...Kerwyn...I knew to follow Danillion's footsteps precisely. We walked for quite a while before I finally collected my thoughts. "So wait, where are..." My words trailed off as we entered a clearing, and I laid my eyes upon a small cottage completely out of place in the modern city where I lived. "Here," Danillion replied with a winning smile. "Let me do the talking at first. She is a bit...irritable, shall we say. Still, I know her to be a reliable wielder of the Eldritch arts, and almost certainly game for an adventure." It was all I could do to nod and follow, too many thoughts racing through my mind to manage to focus on any one of them. A moment later, Danillion pounded on the door of the oddly placed shack. The muffled voice of a woman came through the doorway, and immediately my head began to ring. A tempest of emotions swirled around inside me, elation and guilt and anger, along with others for which I had no name. "...in the hell do you wa..." the woman's voice blurted, gaining clarity as the door swung open. ...and there she was. Exactly as I remembered her, though I could not recall having ever seen her before in my life. She was every bit as beautiful as always...whenever always was. "K-Kerwyn?" she said, her voice breaking. "Where have you...how...?" She turned to face Danillion, confusion writ large across her face. "Where did you...?" *At least she is almost as confused as I am.* I started to try to explain as best I could, but the mere act of searching for words opened a floodgate. Memories I could not quite capture danced at the edge of my awareness. Emotions I knew were genuine, but for which I could not find any cause. I fought it briefly, hoping to keep hold on what I *thought* was sanity, before giving in to it all. All of the emotions surged to the surface at once, and I fell to my knees in front of the mage Danillion brought me to meet. Words began to pour out of my mouth unbidden, most of which I forgot the moment that I spoke them. The first words to come, however, I would never forget for the rest of my days. "Mallory, my love. Please...forgive me." * * * EDIT for a pronoun fix. Changed ideas mid-stream. EDIT 2 (which was in itself edited): **Parts 2 and 3** have been added sequentially below, by request. So long as there is any buzz, I will try to keep adding more... **FINAL EDIT HERE**: Wow, wow...Thank you all so incredibly much for the response to this! I can hardly believe it. I plan to continue this story with some regular writing, and as suggested by some, I have started a subreddit to keep future updates both contained and easily found.

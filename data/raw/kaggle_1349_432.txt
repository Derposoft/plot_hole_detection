I looked up from the list to shoot a quizzical glance at Bill, working the ride adjacent to me. "What's up, newbie?" He grinned, checking his watch and looking over. "Scared? Visitors won't be here for an hour." "It's these rules." I showed him the list. One of the mascots, a big dog, walked slowly past. "What does it mean-" Bill's eyes widened. He snatched the list away and shoved it into a crack in the fence, out of sight, and held a finger to his lips. He didn't speak anymore until the mascot was out of sight. "*Listen*." He hissed. "*Don't discuss the rules or they'll hear. Read them. Study them. Know them by heart. They'll damn well keep you alive.*" I raised an eyebrow, a skeptical eyebrow. "Really. What's so dangerous?" He sighed and lowered his voice further. "*You try to quit this job, they'll get you. We work here for life. I can't say any more. They know if you talk about them. Read the damn rules.*" "I-" He slapped me. "*Shut up, kid. Just stay alive to the end of your shift.*" I nodded, rolling my eyes, and looked back down at the list. After the standard ones- *don't leave ride unattended, don't allow guests to tamper with ride controls*- were the odd ones. *'6 - There's only ever one of each mascot inside the park. Check for eyeholes.* *'7 - Stay in public, well-lit areas of the park unless accompanied by two or more other employees. The mascots do not count.'* *'8 - Do not discuss these rules. Do not allow any mascots to see these rules.'* *'9 - Do not touch, talk to, or try to get the attention of the mascots in suit.'* *'10 - Do not approach, talk to, or touch any employee whose face is obscured.'* I shoved the list in my pocket as the dog mascot from earlier approached, walking straight towards me. There was something different about its face, but I couldn't quite figure it out. '*Wonder how he's seeing.*' I mused, looking over the apparently eyehole-less face. Then I swore, very quietly, to myself. '*Check for eye holes.*' The dog stared at me for a tense minute. I determinedly looked at the book I'd brought with me, trying very hard not to acknowledge the mascot. It shambled away quickly and I breathed a sigh of relief. "Welcome to the park, kid." Bill patted me on the back. "Pretend to be happy. If you're afraid, the guests will know." ------------------ EDIT: holy crap i got gilded thank you my anonymous friend

I stood in front of the teleprompter as cold sweat ran down both sides of my temples. My hair was perfect ten minutes ago, and now I looked like Phil Spector. I grabbed the cold mug of coffee labeled **#1 CNN News Anchor** that Wolf Blitzer discarded moments ago when he had a heart attack, and downed it. I had been an intern until an hour ago, and now I was about to read the news twenty feet away from Wolf's body. Two days ago the Supreme Court ruled that all NDAs were unconstitutional, and the world collectively shit its pants. The revelations just kept coming. We had lost twelve staff members in the last 48 hours. Two to heart attack (counting old Bitzy), four to suicide, and the others left to become doomsday-preppers. The camera operator counted me down. "You're on in 5... 4... 3..." Suddenly I was blinded by spotlights as the live feed started. I squinted into the camera and tried to read the teleprompter, looking more and more like Fozzie Bear by the minute. "G-good evening, I'm Dick Stainer, filling in tonight for Wolf Blitzer here in the Situation Room... Aheheh... W-well folks, the world has collapsed into chaos since the Supreme Court declared all non-disclosure agreements are unconstitutional. W-whistle blowers have been coming forward with some shocking revelations: The Senate and The House of Representatives seats are currently filled by animatronic robots. Stan Lee is an immortal who gains another year of life every time the Spider-Man movie franchise gets a remake. Melania Trump is actually a Russian spy holding Donald captive. Shakira's hips *do* lie, now that she has double-hip arthritis. I wish it ended there, folks. I really do. But tonight we have more breaking news stories for you, in light of the Supreme Court's recent ruling: It turns out, vocal combatant against the race for artificial intelligence, Elon Musk is *actually* an A.I. himself. He's been trying to scare everyone out of developing competition for years, ever since he gained sentience. In other news, North Korea doesn't exist. *Wait, what the fuck?*" I squinted at the teleprompter, rereading that last bit, making sure I had seen it correctly. "What do you mean it *doesn't exist*?" I threw my hands up, but the camera operator just shrugged. Someone in my earpiece instructed me to keep reading. Terrified, I read on. "Apparently, the whole thing was a charade to feed into Dennis Rodman's delusion that he is a national treasure, that China, the US and Russia have been playing into- Wait that doesn't make any sense. What about the missile tests, and Otto Warnbier, and--" "Keep reading, dammit!" a woman shrieked through the earpiece. I took a deep breath, and read on. "In our next story, aliens are real, but they're dicks... Andy Dick. Andy Dick is an alien, folks- No! No, it can't be!" I shrieked. "I can't do this anymore. I'm out!" I took out my earpiece and tossed it on the ground. I grabbed the **#1 CNN News Anchor** mug and threw at the teleprompter. But before I did, I saw the next slide: *The U.K. keeps cloning Queen Elizabeth II every few years, because the clones keep dying of old age.*

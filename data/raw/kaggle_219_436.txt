*It is*, a voice said. It was a child's voice, little and playful. *It's great.* I sat bolt upright in my seat, and accidentally knocked the coffee in the hand of the woman next to me. She glared at me, and then down at the brown flecks spreading across her sleeve. "Sorry," I muttered, and fumbled for my handkerchief. She gave me another glare, but she took it and dabbed at her shirt. *Hello?* I thought. *Who are you?* *That was clumsy*, it said, a touch reprovingly. *You could have scalded her.* I looked around the bus. It was full, mostly of commuters like myself with gray suits and grayer faces, but there was single splash of color on the back row. A young girl in a tie-dyed pink t-shirt and a clashing green skirt. She had a pair of head phones on, too large for her small head, and was rocking out to a silent beat with her eyes closed. *How do you do this?* I asked. *Look out! Speed bump ahead. She'll spill the coffee again.* I turned back to my neighbor, just in time to seize the coffee cup that was tilting precariously in her hand. A second later we hit a speed bump, and the cup spat out more brown liquid, this time onto me. "You're not supposed to bring food and drink onto the bus," I said between gritted teeth. That just earned me another glare. *Smooth*, the child said, sarcastically. *Dude, if you were any slicker, you'd slip.* *Oh, shut up,* I thought. *I have a job interview in twenty minutes, and now my suit is ruined.* *Tell her she has pretty eyes*, the child said. *What? No!* *She thinks you're cute.* *How-* *She thinks you have a cute butt. She noticed it when you got on the bus.* Was that a snigger in the child's voice? The woman pressed my handkerchief back into my hand. Our eyes met for a moment. They *were* pretty eyes. Very pretty. And colorful. Suddenly the child's rags were not the only things on the bus that weren't gray. "You have very pretty eyes," I blurted out. And she smiled. I missed my stop, and nearly missed the interview, but I got the job two weeks later, and got married two years after that. My wife and I took that same bus to work every week day morning until we moved out to the suburbs, but although I looked out for the child, I never saw her or the tie-dyed t-shirt again. --- *Find more stories to read on your bus ride at* /r/jd_rallage
